We report on a comprehensive empirical study using 31 widely traded stock indices over a time period that includes COVID - 19 pandemic. &#9661; More We propose a new approach to volatility modelling by combining deep learning (LSTM) and realized volatility measures. This LSTM-enhanced realized GARCH framework incorporates and distills modeling advances from financial econometrics, high frequency trading data and deep learning. Bayesian inference via the Sequential Monte Carlo method is employed for statistical inference and forecasting. The new framework can jointly model the returns and realized volatility measures, has an excellent in-sample fit and superior predictive performance compared to several benchmark models, while being able to adapt well to the stylized facts in volatility. The performance of the new framework is tested using a wide range of metrics, from marginal likelihood, volatility forecasting, to tail risk forecasting and option pricing. We report on a comprehensive empirical study using 31 widely traded stock indices over a time period that includes COVID - 19 pandemic. &#9651; Less Submitted 15 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

Our work offers an all-in-one scalable solution for extracting and exploring complex information from large-scale research documents, which would otherwise be tedious. First, we briefly explain our knowledge synthesis process to extract helpful information from unstructured text data of research documents. Then, on top of the knowledge extracted from the documents, we perform complex information retrieval using three major components- Paragraph Retrieval, Triplet Retrieval from Knowledge Graphs, and Complex Question Answering (QA). These components combine lexical and semantic-based methods to retrieve paragraphs and triplets and perform faceted refinement for filtering these search results. The complexity of biomedical queries and documents necessitates using a QA system capable of handling queries more complex than factoid queries, which we evaluate qualitatively on the COVID - 19 Open Research Dataset (CORD- 19 ) to demonstrate the effectiveness and value-add. &#9651; Less Submitted 14 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.06799 &nbsp;[ pdf , ps , other ]&nbsp; stat.ME econ.EM Quantiled conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis by Cornish-Fisher expansion Authors: Ningning Zhang , Ke Zhu Abstract : &hellip;of the conditional mean.

These three conditional moments (CMs) are often studied by some parametric models but with two big issues: the risk of model mis-specification and the instability of model estimation. To avoid the above two issues, this paper proposes a novel method to estimate these three CMs by the so-called quantiled CMs (QCMs). The QCM method first adopts the idea of Cornish-Fisher expansion to construct a linear regression model, based on $n$ different estimated conditional quantiles. Next, it computes the QCMs simply and simultaneously by using the ordinary least squares estimator of this regression model, without any prior estimation of the conditional mean. Under certain conditions that allow estimated conditional quantiles to be biased, the QCMs are shown to be consistent with the convergence rate $n^{-1/2}$ . Simulation studies indicate that the QCMs perform well under different scenarios of estimated conditional quantiles. In the application, the study of QCMs for eight major stock indexes demonstrates the effectiveness of financial rescue plans during the COVID - 19 pandemic outbreak, and unveils a new ``non-zero kink&#39;&#39; phenomenon in the ``news impact curve&#39;&#39; function for the conditional kurtosis. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.06611 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; eess.IV Deep Learning and Medical Imaging for COVID - 19 Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Survey Authors: Song Wu , Yazhou Ren , Aodi Yang , Xinyue Chen , Xiaorong Pu , Jing He , Liqiang Nie , Philip S. Yu Abstract : COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More COVID - 19 ( Coronavirus disease 2019) has been quickly spreading since its outbreak, impacting financial markets and healthcare systems globally. Countries all around the world have adopted a number of extraordinary steps to restrict the spreading virus, where early COVID - 19 diagnosis is essential. Medical images such as X-ray images and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main diagnostic tools to combat COVID - 19 with the aid of deep learning-based systems. In this survey, we investigate the main contributions of deep learning applications using medical images in fighting against COVID - 19 from the aspects of image classification, lesion localization, and severity quantification, and review different deep learning architectures and some image preprocessing techniques for achieving a preciser diagnosis. We also provide a summary of the X-ray and CT image datasets used in various studies for COVID - 19 detection. The key difficulties and potential applications of deep learning in fighting against COVID - 19 are finally discussed. This work summarizes the latest methods of deep learning using medical images to diagnose COVID - 19 , highlighting the challenges and inspiring more studies to keep utilizing the advantages of deep learning to combat COVID - 19 . &#9651; Less Submitted 12 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.06566 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.NI Characterizing the VPN Ecosystem in the Wild Authors: Aniss Maghsoudlou , Lukas Vermeulen , Ingmar Poese , Oliver Gasser Abstract : With the shift to working remotely after the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More With the shift to working remotely after the COVID - 19 pandemic, the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) around the world has nearly doubled. Therefore, measuring the traffic and security aspects of the VPN ecosystem is more important now than ever. It is, however, challenging to detect and characterize VPN traffic since some VPN protocols use the same port number as web traffic and port-based traffic classification will not help. VPN users are also concerned about the vulnerabilities of their VPN connections due to privacy issues. In this paper, we aim at detecting and characterizing VPN servers in the wild, which facilitates detecting the VPN traffic. To this end, we perform Internet-wide active measurements to find VPN servers in the wild, and characterize them based on their vulnerabilities, certificates, locations, and fingerprinting. We find 9.8M VPN servers distributed around the world using OpenVPN, SSTP, PPTP, and IPsec, and analyze their vulnerability. We find SSTP to be the most vulnerable protocol with more than 90% of detected servers being vulnerable to TLS downgrade attacks. Of all the servers that respond to our VPN probes, 2 % also respond to HTTP probes and therefore are classified as Web servers. We apply our list of VPN servers to the traffic from a large European ISP and observe that 2.6% of all traffic is related to these VPN servers. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

With the recent COVID - 19 outbreak, the concern and efforts to restore global health and well-being are rising at an unprecedented rate. A requirement to develop precise, fast, point-of-care, reliable, easily disposable/reproducible and low-cost diagnostic tools have ascended. Biosensors form a primary element of hand-held medical kits, tools, products, and/or instruments. They have a very wide range of applications such as nearby environmental checks, detecting the onset of a disease, food quality, drug discovery, medicine dose control, and many more. Thischapter explains how Nano/Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (N/MEMS) can be enabling technology towards a sustainable, scalable, ultra-miniaturized, easy-to-use, energy efficient, and integrated bio/chemical sensing system. This study provides a deeper insight into the fundamentals, recent advances, and potential end applications of N/MEMS sensors and integrated systems to detect and measure the concentration of biological and/or chemical analytes. Transduction principle/s, materials, efficient designs including readout technique, and sensor performance are explained. This is followed by a discussion on how N/MEMS biosensors continue to evolve. The challenges and possible opportunities are also discussed. &#9651; Less Submitted 10 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.05884 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.LG Exploration of carbonate aggregates in road construction using ultrasonic and artificial intelligence approaches Authors: Mohamed Abdelhedi , Rateb Jabbar , Chedly Abbes Abstract : The COVID - 19 pandemic has significantly impacted the construction sector, which is sensitive to economic cycles.

In order to boost value and efficiency in this sector, the use of innovative exploration technologies such as ultrasonic and Artificial Intelligence techniques in building material research is becoming increasingly crucial. In this study, we developed two models for predicting the Los Angeles (LA) and Micro Deval (MDE) coefficients, two important geotechnical tests used to determine the quality of rock aggregates. These coefficients describe the resistance of aggregates to fragmentation and abrasion. The ultrasound velocity, porosity, and density of the rocks were determined and used as inputs to develop prediction models using multiple regression and an artificial neural network. These models may be used to assess the quality of rock aggregates at the exploration stage without the need for tedious laboratory analysis. &#9651; Less Submitted 12 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

The problem of medical waste recycling and treatment has gradually drawn concerns from the whole society. The sudden outbreak of the COVID - 19 epidemic further brought new challenges. To tackle the challenges, this study proposes a reverse logistics system architecture with three modules, i.e., medical waste classification &amp; monitoring module, temporary storage &amp; disposal site selection module, as well as route optimization module. This overall solution design won the Grand Prize of the &#34;YUNFENG CUP&#34; China National Contest on Green Supply and Reverse Logistics Design ranking 1st. This paper focuses on the description of architectural design and the first two modules, especially the module on site selection. Specifically, regarding the medical waste classification &amp; monitoring module, three main entities, i.e., relevant government departments, hospitals, and logistics companies, are identified, which are involved in the five management functions of this module. Detailed data flow diagrams are provided to illustrate the information flow and the responsibilities of each entity. Regarding the site selection module, a multi-objective optimization model is developed, and considering different types of waste collection sites (i.e., prioritized large collection sites and common collection sites), a hierarchical solution method is developed employing linear programming and K-means clustering algorithms sequentially. The proposed site selection method is verified with a case study and compared with the baseline, it can immensely reduce the daily operational costs and working time. Limited by length, detailed descriptions of the whole system and the remaining route optimization module can be found at https://shorturl.at/cdY59. &#9651; Less Submitted 14 February, 2023; v1 submitted 9 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

There have been important extensions to model heterogeneous populations, when the identity of the sub-populations is known, such as age group or geographical location. Here, we propose two new methods to model the number of people infected with COVID - 19 over time, each as a linear combination of latent sub-populations -- i.e., when we do not know which person is in which sub-population, and the only available observations are the aggregates across all sub-populations. Method #1 is a dictionary-based approach, which begins with a large number of pre-defined sub-population models (each with its own starting time, shape, etc), then determines the (positive) weight of small (learned) number of sub-populations. Method # 2 is a mixture-of-$M$ fittable curves, where $M$, the number of sub-populations to use, is given by the user. Both methods are compatible with any parametric model; here we demonstrate their use with first (a)~Gaussian curves and then (b)~SIR trajectories. We empirically show the performance of the proposed methods, first in (i) modeling the observed data and then in (ii) forecasting the number of infected people 1 to 4 weeks in advance. Across 187 countries, we show that the dictionary approach had the lowest mean absolute percentage error and also the lowest variance when compared with classical SIR models and moreover, it was a strong baseline that outperforms many of the models developed for COVID - 19 forecasting. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

A document review was used as the main method of data collection using the datasets from the Philippine Statistics Authority- Annual Statistical Yearbook (PSA-ASY). The dataset contained the volume of index crimes in the Philippines from 2016 to 2020. The index crimes were broken down into two major categories: crimes against persons and crimes against property. Incidence of crime-by-crime type was available for different administrative regions in the Philippines. Chi-square test and correlation plot of chi-square residual were used to determine the associations between the locations and types of index crimes. A correlation plot of the chisquare residual was used to investigate the patterns of associations. Results suggest that the continuing effort of the Philippine government to fight against criminality has resulted in a steady decline in the incidence of index crimes in the Philippines. The pandemic too contributed to the decline of crime incidence in the country. These results imply that police surveillance activities in highly populated areas and specific interventions to address sexual violence must be in place during community lockdowns. The Philippine National Police should heighten its campaign in violence against women and increase its workforce visibility especially in remote and densely populated areas. The results of this study can be used as input to local government units for developing programs and plans on crime prevention. For future researches, it is recommended to conduct a precinct level analysis for a closer look at crime surveillance. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

Ceballos Abstract : The coronavirus disease (&hellip; &#9661; More The coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) has spread worldwide with an unprecedented impact on society. In the Philippines, several interventions such as mobility restrictions for different age groups and vaccination prioritization programs have been implemented to reduce the risks of infections and mortality. This study aimed to identify age-sex composition with greater susceptibility, longer hospitalization and higher fatality. The COVID - 19 cases from March 2020 to April 2021 provided by the Department of Health Davao Region in the Philippines were analyzed. A Chi-square test was used to determine the difference in proportions of COVID - 19 cases among age-sex compositions. A correlation plot of \c{hi} 2 test residual was employed to investigate the differences in susceptibility. Boxplots and Kruskal-Wallis tests were utilized to compare the length of hospitalizations. The study found a significant difference in the COVID - 19 susceptibility among age-sex compositions (p &lt; 0.01). Male children and female senior citizens were the most susceptible age-sex compositions. Furthermore, senior citizens had the longest hospital days wherein the median and IQR days were 19 (15-27) for men and 18 (16-29) for women. Male senior citizen was the subgroup with the highest case fatality (21.4%, p &lt; 0.01). It is recommended that the number of cases among senior citizens be used as an input in the planning and allocation of medical resources at the provincial and regional levels. The local government unit executives in the region can also take advantage of the availability of age-sex composition data in stratifying localities, planning, allocating COVID - 19 -related resources and imposing mobility restrictions. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

In this paper, using data gathered from Twitter, including tweets and user profiles, we offer a comprehensive analysis of public opinion in Iran about the Coronavirus vaccines. For this purpose, we applied a search query technique combined with a topic modeling approach to extract vaccine-related tweets. We utilized transformer-based models to classify the content of the tweets and extract themes revolving around vaccination. We also conducted an emotion analysis to evaluate the public happiness and anger around this topic. Our results demonstrate that Covid - 19 vaccination has attracted considerable attention from different angles, such as governmental issues, safety or hesitancy, and side effects. Moreover, Coronavirus -relevant phenomena like public vaccination and the rate of infection deeply impacted public emotional status and users&#39; interactions. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

They are often designed not just to inform, but to persuade people to make consequential decisions (e.g., to get vaccinated).

In this paper we examine the impact of existing attitudes (e.g., positive or negative attitudes toward COVID - 19 vaccination) on changes in beliefs about statistical correlations when viewing scatterplot visualizations with different representations of statistical uncertainty. We find that strong prior attitudes are associated with smaller belief changes when presented with data that contradicts existing views, and that visual uncertainty representations may amplify this effect. Finally, even when participants&#39; beliefs about correlations shifted their attitudes remained unchanged, highlighting the need for further research on whether data visualizations can drive longer-term changes in views and behavior. &#9651; Less Submitted 7 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

These effects are continuing today. One strategy for limiting the virus&#39;s transmission is to have an early diagnosis of suspected cases and take appropriate measures before the disease spreads further. This work aims to diagnose and show the probability of getting infected by the disease according to textual clinical data. In this work, we used five machine learning techniques (GWO_MLP, GWO_CMLP, MGWO_MLP, FDO_MLP, FDO_CMLP) all of which aim to classify Covid - 19 patients into two categories (Positive and Negative). Experiments showed promising results for all used models. The applied methods showed very similar performance, typically in terms of accuracy. However, in each tested dataset, FDO_MLP and FDO_CMLP produced the best results with 100% accuracy. The other models&#39; results varied from one experiment to the other. It is concluded that the models on which the FDO algorithm was used as a learning algorithm had the possibility of obtaining higher accuracy.

The parameters of the model are tuned by minimising the distance between the probability distributions of ordinal patterns generated by the real and synthetic sequences, as estimated by the Permutation Jensen-Shannon Distance. We show that the correlation between consecutive hours in the landing flow changes between airports, and that it can be interpreted as a metric of efficiency.

COVID - 19 is a rapidly spreading infectious disease that infects humans faster. Therefore, efficient diagnostic systems may accurately identify infected patients and thus help control their spread. In this regard, a new two-stage analysis framework is developed to analyze minute irregularities of COVID - 19 infection. A novel detection Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), STM-BRNet, is developed that incorporates the Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block and channel boosting (CB) to identify COVID - 19 infected CT slices in the first stage. Each STM block extracts boundary and region-smoothing-specific features for COVID - 19 infection detection. Moreover, the various boosted channels are obtained by introducing the new CB and Transfer Learning (TL) concept in STM blocks to capture small illumination and texture variations of COVID - 19 -specific images. The COVID - 19 CTs are provided with new SA-CB-BRSeg segmentation CNN for delineating infection in images in the second stage. SA-CB-BRSeg methodically utilized smoothening and heterogeneous operations in the encoder and decoder to capture simultaneously COVID - 19 specific patterns that are region homogeneity, texture variation, and boundaries. Additionally, the new CB concept is introduced in the decoder of SA-CB-BRSeg by combining additional channels using TL to learn the low contrast region. The proposed STM-BRNet and SA-CB-BRSeg yield considerable achievement in accuracy: 98.01 %, Recall: 98.12%, F-score: 98.11%, and Dice Similarity: 96.396%, IOU: 98.845 % for the COVID - 19 infectious region, respectively. The proposed two-stage framework significantly increased performance compared to single-phase and other reported systems and reduced the burden on the radiologists. &#9651; Less Submitted 6 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

Schmidt , Yannan Shen , David Buckeridge Abstract : Recurrent COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Recurrent COVID - 19 outbreaks have placed immense strain on the hospital system in Quebec. We develop a Bayesian three-state coupled Markov switching model to analyze COVID - 19 outbreaks across Quebec based on admissions in the 30 largest hospitals. Within each catchment area we assume the existence of three states for the disease: absence, a new state meant to account for many zeroes in some of the smaller areas, endemic and outbreak. Then we assume the disease switches between the three states in each area through a series of coupled nonhomogeneous hidden Markov chains. Unlike previous approaches, the transition probabilities may depend on covariates and the occurrence of outbreaks in neighboring areas, to account for geographical outbreak spread. Additionally, to prevent rapid switching between endemic and outbreak periods we introduce clone states into the model which enforce minimum endemic and outbreak durations. We make some interesting findings such as that mobility in retail and recreation venues had a strong positive association with the development and persistence of new COVID - 19 outbreaks in Quebec. Based on model comparison our contributions show promise in improving state estimation retrospectively and in real-time, especially when there are smaller areas and highly spatially synchronized outbreaks, and they offer new and interesting epidemiological interpretations. &#9651; Less Submitted 5 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.02481 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.DC Distributed Computation Offloading of an application from mobile/IoT device to cloud Authors: Arsalan Liaqat , Saqib Ilyas , Ghazala Mushtaq Abstract : In Covid - 19 pandemic, the number of users connecting to the Internet using mobile devices increased.

People are doing there every task using mobile phones [16]. These devices are battery-powered and have limited computation capabilities. Their computational capabilities can be enhanced by computation offloading in which required computation is to be done on a third-party server on a cloud instead of the device itself. The cloud offers virtually infinite computation and storage. We proposed that by exploiting parallelism within an application call hierarchy we can decrease the execution time of off-loadable parts and minimize data resend in case of VM crash. We determine function call paths that are independent of each other within an application and schedule each of them on separate VMs in a distributed way. Wherever such independent paths merge, we collapse to a single VM and whenever the paths diverge again, we schedule multiple VMs. If any single VM fails another copy will be created. However, only the code and data associated with the crashed VM needs to be re-transmitted from the client device. In the case of face reorganization application and montage application we decrease execution time to 27.5% and 43.43% respectively. Whereas the data resend in case if any of both VMs crash will be the portion of the application that had been offloaded to respective VM at depending upon the level of parallelism they have which save mobile battery in case of Resend. We will also discuss the energy consumption effect of using multiple Vms for a job VS single Vm for the same job. &#9651; Less Submitted 5 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.02314 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG CECT: Controllable Ensemble CNN and Transformer for COVID - 19 image classification by capturing both local and global image features Authors: Zhaoshan Liu , Lei Shen Abstract : &hellip;and global scales, and the contribution of local features at different scales can be controlled with the proposed ensemble coefficients.

Different from conventional CNN- or transformer-based methods, our CECT can capture features at both multi-local and global scales, and the contribution of local features at different scales can be controlled with the proposed ensemble coefficients.

In the last 2 and a half years, during the COVID - 19 pandemic, universities made immediate use of learning technologies, providing students with access to online learning content and platforms. Previous considerations on how to better integrate technology into universities or how the institutions can be better prepared in terms of infrastructure vanished almost immediately due to the necessity of immediate actions towards the need for social distance and global health. The present study proposes a framework for university students metaverse technologies in education acceptance and intention to use. The present study develops a structural model of MetaEducation acceptance. This model will be useful to university managers, policymakers, and professors to better incorporate the upcoming metaverse technology. The present study tests (if supported) the correlations among the aforementioned constructs. Preliminary results show hesitance to use MetaEducation technologies from university students. Self-efficacy and Subjective Norms affect Attitude and Perceived Usefulness positively, but on the other side, there is no strong correlation between Perceived Ease of Use and Attitude or Perceived Usefulness and Attitude. Authors believe that the weak ties among the study constructs have to do with the lack of knowledge of what really MetaEducation really is, and which are its advantages of use. &#9651; Less Submitted 4 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

In this paper, we suggest a multiobjective perspective on the training of PINNs by treating the data loss and the residual loss as two individual objective functions in a truly biobjective optimization approach. As a showcase example, we consider COVID - 19 predictions in Germany and built an extended susceptibles-infected-recovered (SIR) model with additionally considered leaky-vaccinated and hospitalized populations (SVIHR model) to model the transition rates and to predict future infections. SIR-type models are expressed by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We investigate the suitability of the generated PINN for COVID - 19 predictions and compare the resulting predicted curves with those obtained by applying the method of non-standard finite differences to the system of ODEs and initial data. The approach is applicable to various systems of ODEs that define dynamical regimes. Those regimes do not need to be SIR-type models, and the corresponding underlying data sets do not have to be associated with COVID - 19 . &#9651; Less Submitted 3 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

And conduct a retrospective data analysis utilizing chart review-based validation. Participants are 586 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during January 2022. We used natural language processing to incorporate data from provider notes and LASSO regression and Random Forests to fit classification algorithms that incorporated structured EHR data elements, provider notes, or a combination of structured data and provider notes. Results: Based on a chart review, 38% of 586 patients were determined to be hospitalized for reasons other than COVID - 19 despite having tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . A classification algorithm that used provider notes had significantly better discrimination than one that used structured EHR data elements (AUROC: 0.894 vs 0.841, p &lt; 0.001), and performed similarly to a model that combined provider notes with structured data elements (AUROC: 0.894 vs 0.893).

This work demonstrates the utility of natural language processing approaches to derive information related to patient hospitalizations in cases where there may be multiple conditions that could serve as the primary indication for hospitalization. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

In five real world dynamic graphs, we demonstrate that LAD and MultiLAD identify significant events as top anomalies such as the implementation of government COVID - 19 interventions which impacted the population mobility in multi-view traffic networks. &#9661; More Dynamic graphs are rich data structures that are used to model complex relationships between entities over time. In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems, detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address three main challenges associated with this problem: i). how to compare graph snapshots across time, ii). how to capture temporal dependencies, and iii). how to combine different views of a temporal graph. To solve the above challenges, we first propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of graph Laplacian as the low dimensional embedding of the graph structure at each snapshot. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. Next, we propose MultiLAD, a simple and effective generalization of LAD to multi-view graphs. MultiLAD provides the first change point detection method for multi-view dynamic graphs. It aggregates the singular values of the normalized graph Laplacian from different views through the scalar power mean operation. Through extensive synthetic experiments, we show that i). LAD and MultiLAD are accurate and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and their multi-view extensions by a large margin, ii). MultiLAD&#39;s advantage over contenders significantly increases when additional views are available, and iii). MultiLAD is highly robust to noise from individual views. In five real world dynamic graphs, we demonstrate that LAD and MultiLAD identify significant events as top anomalies such as the implementation of government COVID - 19 interventions which impacted the population mobility in multi-view traffic networks. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023.

We arrange the inputs of the transformer in such a way that predictions for different states can attend to the trends of the others. To overcome the issue of scarcity of training data for this COVID - 19 pandemic, we have developed a novel data augmentation technique to generate useful data for training. More importantly, the generated data can also be used for model validation. As such, it has a two-fold advantage: 1) more actual observations can be used for training, and 2 ) the model can be validated on data which has distribution closer to the expected situation. Our model has achieved some of the best state-level results on the COVID - 19 Forecast Hub for the US and for Germany. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.01076 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; q-bio.PE Convergence to the Equilibrium State in an Outbreak: When Can Growth Rates Accurately be Measured?

In this work, motivated by recent natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and quantify opinions from text messages, we present a differential framework for bivariate opinion formation dynamics that is coupled with a compartmental model for fake news dissemination. Thanks to a mean-field analysis we demonstrate that the resulting Fokker-Planck system permits to reproduce bimodal distributions of opinions as observed in polarization dynamics. The model is then applied to sentiment analysis data from social media platforms in Italy, in order to analyze the evolution of opinions about Covid - 19 vaccination. We show through numerical simulations that the model is capable to describe correctly the formation of the bimodal opinion structure observed in the vaccine-hesitant dataset, which is witness of the known polarization effects that happen within closed online communities. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.00863 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; q-bio.QM cs.CY The Challenges and Opportunities in Creating an Early Warning System for Global Pandemics Authors: David C.

Yet, during the last half of 2022, and quite remarkably, we began dismantling essential infectious disease monitoring programs in several countries. Absent such programs, localized biological risks will transform into global shocks linked directly to our lack of foresight regarding emerging health risks. Additionally, recent studies indicate that more than half of all infectious diseases could be made worse by climate change, complicating pandemic containment. Despite this complexity, the factors leading to pandemics are largely predictable but can only be realized through a well-designed global early warning system. Such a system should integrate data from genomics, climate and environment, social dynamics, and healthcare infrastructure. The glue for such a system is community-driven modeling, a modern logistics of data, and democratization of AI tools. Using the example of dengue fever in Brazil, we can demonstrate how thoughtfully designed technology platforms can build global-scale precision disease detection and response systems that significantly reduce exposure to systemic shocks, accelerate science-informed public health policies, and deliver reliable healthcare and economic opportunities as an intrinsic part of the global sustainable development agenda. &#9651; Less Submitted 1 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023. arXiv:2302.00606 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CL The RW3D: A multi-modal panel dataset to understand the psychological impact of the pandemic Authors: Isabelle van der Vegt , Bennett Kleinberg Abstract : Besides far-reaching public health consequences, the COVID - 19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact on people around the world.

An implementation of the methods using the popular machine learning library PyTorch is freely available. &#9661; More Sensitivity analysis measures the influence of a Bayesian network&#39;s parameters on a quantity of interest defined by the network, such as the probability of a variable taking a specific value. Various sensitivity measures have been defined to quantify such influence, most commonly some function of the quantity of interest&#39;s partial derivative with respect to the network&#39;s conditional probabilities. However, computing these measures in large networks with thousands of parameters can become computationally very expensive. We propose an algorithm combining automatic differentiation and exact inference to efficiently calculate the sensitivity measures in a single pass. It first marginalizes the whole network once, using e.g. variable elimination, and then backpropagates this operation to obtain the gradient with respect to all input parameters. Our method can be used for one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis and the derivation of admissible regions. Simulation studies highlight the efficiency of our algorithm by scaling it to massive networks with up to 100&#39;000 parameters and investigate the feasibility of generic multi-way analyses.

We use numerical studies of simulated data and an application to COVID - 19 data collected from 32 hospitals in Mexico, to illustrate the proposed method. &#9661; More The analysis of data stored in multiple sites has become more popular, raising new concerns about the security of data storage and communication. Federated learning, which does not require centralizing data, is a common approach to preventing heavy data transportation, securing valued data, and protecting personal information protection. Therefore, determining how to aggregate the information obtained from the analysis of data in separate local sites has become an important statistical issue. The commonly used averaging methods may not be suitable due to data nonhomogeneity and incomparable results among individual sites, and applying them may result in the loss of information obtained from the individual analyses. Using a sequential method in federated learning with distributed computing can facilitate the integration and accelerate the analysis process. We develop a data-driven method for efficiently and effectively aggregating valued information by analyzing local data without encountering potential issues such as information security and heavy transportation due to data communication. In addition, the proposed method can preserve the properties of classical sequential adaptive design, such as data-driven sample size and estimation precision when applied to generalized linear models.

It has been hypothesised that quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models struggle to predict ACs and that ACs thus form a major source of prediction error. However, a study to explore the AC-prediction power of modern QSAR methods and its relationship to general QSAR-prediction performance is lacking. We systematically construct nine distinct QSAR models by combining three molecular representation methods (extended-connectivity fingerprints, physicochemical-descriptor vectors and graph isomorphism networks) with three regression techniques (random forests, k-nearest neighbours and multilayer perceptrons); we then use each resulting model to classify pairs of similar compounds as ACs or non-ACs and to predict the activities of individual molecules in three case studies: dopamine receptor D2, factor Xa, and SARS - CoV - 2 main protease. We observe low AC-sensitivity amongst the tested models when the activities of both compounds are unknown, but a substantial increase in AC-sensitivity when the actual activity of one of the compounds is given. Graph isomorphism features are found to be competitive with or superior to classical molecular representations for AC-classification and can thus be employed as baseline AC-prediction models or simple compound-optimisation tools. For general QSAR-prediction, however, extended-connectivity fingerprints still consistently deliver the best performance. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that indeed QSAR methods frequently fail to predict ACs. We propose twin-network training for deep learning models as a potential future pathway to increase AC-sensitivity and thus overall QSAR performance. &#9651; Less Submitted 31 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

This hierarchical structure of disease spread is influenced primarily by the multiscale structure of human mobility. However, during the COVID - 19 epidemic, public health responses typically did not take into consideration the explicit spatial structure of human mobility when designing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). NPIs were applied primarily at national or regional scales. Here we use weekly anonymized and aggregated human mobility data and spatially highly resolved data on COVID - 19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations at the municipality level in Mexico to investigate how behavioural changes in response to the pandemic have altered the spatial scales of transmission and interventions during its first wave (March - June 2020). We find that the epidemic dynamics in Mexico were initially driven by SARS - CoV - 2 exports from Mexico State and Mexico City, where early outbreaks occurred. The mobility network shifted after the implementation of interventions in late March 2020, and the mobility network communities became more disjointed while epidemics in these communities became increasingly synchronised. Our results provide actionable and dynamic insights into how to use network science and epidemiological modelling to inform the spatial scale at which interventions are most impactful in mitigating the spread of COVID - 19 and infectious diseases in general. &#9651; Less Submitted 30 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.12975 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph At the crossroads of epidemiology and biology: bridging the gap between SARS - CoV - 2 viral strain properties and epidemic wave characteristics Authors: Florian Poydenot , Alice Lebreton , Jacques Haiech , Bruno Andreotti Abstract : The COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More The COVID - 19 pandemic has given rise to numerous articles from different scientific fields (epidemiology, virology, immunology, airflow physics...) without any effort to link these different insights. In this review, we aim to establish relationships between epidemiological data and the characteristics of the virus strain responsible for the epidemic wave concerned. We have carried out this study on the Wuhan, Alpha, Delta and Omicron strains allowing us to illustrate the evolution of the relationships we have highlighted according to these different viral strains. We addressed the following questions: 1) How can the mean infectious dose (one quantum, by definition in epidemiology) be measured and expressed as an amount of viral RNA molecules (in genome units, GU) or as a number of replicative viral particles (in plaque-forming units, PFU)? 2 ) How many infectious quanta are exhaled by an infected person per unit of time? 3) How many infectious quanta are exhaled, on average, integrated over the whole contagious period? 4) How do these quantities relate to the epidemic reproduction rate R as measured in epidemiology, and to the viral load, as measured by molecular biological methods? 5) How has the infectious dose evolved with the different strains of SARS - CoV - 2 ? We make use of state-of-the-art modelling, reviewed and explained in the appendix of the article (Supplemental Information, SI), to answer these questions using data from the literature in both epidemiology and virology. We have considered the modification of these relationships according to the vaccination status of the population. We hope that this work will allow a better integration of data from different fields (virology, epidemiology, and immunology) to anticipate the evolution of the epidemic in the case of COVID - 19 , but also in respiratory pathologies transmissible in an airborne manner. &#9651; Less Submitted 30 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

As individual-based models are computationally intensive, it is pivotal to identify optimal strategies within a reasonable computational budget. Moreover, due to the high societal impact associated with the implementation of preventive strategies, uncertainty regarding decisions should be communicated to policy makers, which is naturally embedded in a Bayesian approach. We present a novel technique for evaluating vaccine allocation strategies using a multi-armed bandit framework in combination with a Bayesian anytime $m$-top exploration algorithm. $m$-top exploration allows the algorithm to learn $m$ policies for which it expects the highest utility, enabling experts to inspect this small set of alternative strategies, along with their quantified uncertainty. The anytime component provides policy advisors with flexibility regarding the computation time and the desired confidence, which is important as it is difficult to make this trade-off beforehand. We consider the Belgian COVID - 19 epidemic using the individual-based model STRIDE, where we learn a set of vaccination policies that minimize the number of infections and hospitalisations. Through experiments we show that our method can efficiently identify the $m$-top policies, which is validated in a scenario where the ground truth is available. Finally, we explore how vaccination policies can best be organised under different contact reduction schemes. Through these experiments, we show that the top policies follow a clear trend regarding the prioritised age groups and assigned vaccine type, which provides insights for future vaccination campaigns. &#9651; Less Submitted 30 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.12340 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; eess.IV cs.CV A novel method using machine learning to integrate features from lung and epicardial adipose tissue for detecting the severity of COVID - 19 infection Authors: Ni Yao , Yanhui Tian , Daniel Gama das Neves , Chen Zhao , Claudio Tinoco Mesquita , Wolney de Andrade Martins , Alair Augusto Sarmet Moreira Damas dos Santos , Yanting Li , Chuang Han , Fubao Zhu , Neng Dai , Weihua Zhou Abstract : Objectives: To investigate the value of radiomics features of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) combined with lung for detecting the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&hellip; &#9661; More Objectives: To investigate the value of radiomics features of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) combined with lung for detecting the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) infection. Methods: The retrospective study included data from 515 COVID - 19 patients (Cohort1: 415, cohort2: 100) from the two centers between January 2020 and July 2020. A deep learning method was developed to extract the myocardium and visceral pericardium from chest CTs, and then a threshold was applied for automatic EAT extraction. Lung segmentation was achieved according to a published method. Radiomics features of both EAT and lung were extracted for the severity prediction. In a derivation cohort (290, cohort1), univariate analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used to identify predictors of the severity of COVID - 19 . A generalized linear regression model for detecting the severity of COVID - 19 was built in a derivation cohort and evaluated in internal (125, cohort1) and external (100, cohort2) validation cohorts. Results: For EAT extraction, the Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of the two centers were 0.972 (0.011) and 0.968 (0.005), respectively. For severity detection, the AUC, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of the model with radiomics features of both lung and EAT increased by 0.09 (p&lt;0.001), 22.4%, and 17.0%, respectively, compared with the model with lung radiomics features, in the internal validation cohort. The AUC, NRI, and IDI increased by 0.04 (p&lt;0.001), 11.1%, and 8.0%, respectively, in the external validation cohort. Conclusion: Radiomics features of EAT combined with lung have incremental value in detecting the severity of COVID - 19 . &#9651; Less Submitted 28 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Software developers have relied on remote collaborations long before the pandemic, working in virtual teams (GitHub repositories). The dynamics of these repositories through the pandemic provide a unique opportunity to understand how remote teams react under shock. This work presents a systematic analysis. We measure the overall effect of the early pandemic on public GitHub repositories by comparing their sizes and productivity with the counterfactual outcomes forecasted as if there were no pandemic. We find that the productivity level and the number of active members of these teams vary significantly during different periods of the pandemic. We then conduct a finer-grained investigation and study the heterogeneous effects of the shock on individual teams. We find that the resilience of a team is highly correlated to certain properties of the team before the pandemic. Through a bootstrapped regression analysis, we reveal which types of teams are robust or fragile to the shock. &#9651; Less Submitted 28 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

In this work, we use natural language processing tools to measure these biases in a large corpus of news articles about the Covid - 19 pandemic. Specifically, we identify when experts are quoted in news and extract their names and institutional affiliations. We enrich the data by classifying each expert&#39;s gender, the type of organization they belong to, and for academic institutions, their ranking. Our analysis reveals disparities in the representation of experts in news. We find a substantial gender gap, where men are quoted three times more than women. The gender gap varies by partisanship of the news source, with conservative media exhibiting greater gender bias. We also identify academic prestige bias, where journalists turn to experts from highly-ranked academic institutions more than experts from less prestigious institutions, even if the latter group has more public health expertise. Liberal news sources exhibit slightly more prestige bias than conservative sources. Equality of representation is essential to enable voices from all groups to be heard. By auditing bias, our methods help identify blind spots in news coverage. &#9651; Less Submitted 27 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.11811 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.HC doi 10.11591/ijeecs.v28.i1.pp328-338 A systematic review of structural equation modeling in augmented reality applications Authors: Vinh The Nguyen , Chuyen Thi Hong Nguyen Abstract : The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive review of the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) in augmented reality (AR) studies in the context of the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive review of the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) in augmented reality (AR) studies in the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic.

Stanley Young , Warren B. Kindzierski Abstract : The coronavirus pandemic (&hellip; &#9661; More The coronavirus pandemic ( COVID ) has been an extraordinary test of modern government scientific procedures that inform and shape policy. Many governments implemented COVID quarantine (stay-at-home) orders on the notion that this nonpharmaceutical intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and largely benefit public health outcomes. The overall research capacity response to COVID since late 2019 has been massive. Given lack of research transparency, only a small fraction of published research has been judged by others to be reproducible before COVID . Independent evaluation of published meta-analysis on a common research question can be used to assess the reproducibility of a claim coming from that field of research. We used a p-value plotting statistical method to independently evaluate reproducibility of specific research claims made in four meta-analysis studies related to benefits/risks of COVID quarantine orders. Outcomes we investigated included: mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence, and suicidal ideation (thoughts of killing yourself). Three of the four meta-analyses that we evaluated (mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence) raise further questions about benefits/risks of this form of intervention. The fourth meta-analysis study (suicidal ideation) is unreliable. Given lack of research transparency and irreproducibility of published research, independent evaluation of meta-analysis studies using p-value plotting is offered as a way to strengthen or refute (falsify) claims made in COVID research. &#9651; Less Submitted 23 December, 2022; originally announced January 2023.

In Japan, hand-washing education in primary schools was positively correlated with preventive behaviours against COVID - 19 transmission for adults in 2020 during the early stages of COVID - 19 [1]. The following year, the Tokyo Olympics were held in Japan, and a state of emergency was declared several times. Public perceptions of and risks associated with the pandemic changed drastically with the emergence of COVID - 19 vaccines. We re-examine whether effect of hand-washing education on preventive behaviours persisted by covering a longer period of the COVID - 19 pandemic than previous studies. 26 surveys were conducted nearly once a month for 30 months from March 2020 (the early stage of COVID - 19 ) to September 2022 in Japan. By corresponding with the same individuals across surveys, we comprehensively gathered data on preventive behaviours during this period. In addition, we asked about hand-washing education they had received in their primary school. We used the data to investigate how and the degree to which school education is associated with pandemic mitigating preventive behaviours. We found that hand-washing education in primary school is positively associated with behaviours such as hand washing and mask wearing as a COVID - 19 preventive measure, but not related to staying at home. We observed a statistically significant difference in hand washing between adults who received childhood hand-washing education and those who did not. This difference persisted throughout the study period. In comparison, the difference in mask wearing between the two groups was smaller, but still statistically significant. Furthermore, there was no difference in staying at home between them. &#9651; Less Submitted 26 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.11318 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CL cs.SI q-fin.GN Contextualizing Emerging Trends in Financial News Articles Authors: Nhu Khoa Nguyen , Thierry Delahaut , Emanuela Boros , Antoine Doucet , Gaël Lejeune Abstract : &hellip;thus, more challenging.

The pandemic&#39;s seriousness made people vocal on social media, especially on microblogs such as Twitter. Researchers have been collecting and sharing large-scale datasets of COVID - 19 tweets since the early days of the outbreak. Sharing raw Twitter data with third parties is restricted; users need to hydrate tweet identifiers in a public dataset to re-create the dataset locally. Large-scale datasets that include original tweets, retweets, quotes, and replies have tweets in billions which takes months to hydrate. The existing datasets carry issues related to proportion and redundancy. We report that more than 500 million tweet identifiers point to deleted or protected tweets. Avoiding hydrating the unavailable tweets alone would save almost two months in a single hydration task. In order to address these issues, this paper introduces an enriched global billion-scale English-language COVID - 19 tweets dataset, BillionCOV, that contains 1.4 billion tweets originating from 240 countries and territories between October 2019 and April 2022. The objective of BillionCOV is to facilitate researchers to filter tweet identifiers per their requirements for efficient hydration.

Since memes instantly turn viral, it becomes crucial to infer their intent and potentially associated harmfulness to take timely measures as needed. A common problem associated with meme comprehension lies in detecting the entities referenced and characterizing the role of each of these entities.

Its central technique, persistent homology, has had tremendous success in many science and engineering disciplines. However, persistent homology has limitations, including its incapability of describing the homotopic shape evolution of data during filtration. Persistent topological Laplacians (PTLs), such as persistent Laplacian and persistent sheaf Laplacian, were proposed to overcome the drawback of persistent homology. In this work, we examine the modeling and analysis power of PTLs in the study of the protein structures of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and its variants, i.e., Alpha, Beta, Gamma, BA.1, and BA. 2 . First, we employ PTLs to study how the RBD mutation-induced structural changes of RBD-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding complexes are captured in the changes of spectra of the PTLs among SARS - CoV - 2 variants. Additionally, we use PTLs to analyze the binding of RBD and ACE2-induced structural changes of various SARS - CoV - 2 variants. Finally, we explore the impacts of computationally generated RBD structures on PTL-based machine learning, including deep learning, and predictions of deep mutational scanning datasets for the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron BA. 2 variant. Our results indicate that PTLs have advantages over persistent homology in analyzing protein structural changes and provide a powerful new TDA tool for data science. &#9651; Less Submitted 25 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.10840 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.LG cs.AI Improved Bitcoin Price Prediction based on COVID - 19 data Authors: Palina Niamkova , Rafael Moreira Abstract : Social turbulence can affect people financial decisions, causing changes in spending and saving.

During a global turbulence as significant as the COVID - 19 pandemic, such changes are inevitable. Here we examine how the effects of COVID - 19 on various jurisdictions influenced the global price of Bitcoin. We hypothesize that lock downs and expectations of economic recession erode people trust in fiat (government-issued) currencies, thus elevating cryptocurrencies. Hence, we expect to identify a causal relation between the turbulence caused by the pandemic, demand for Bitcoin, and ultimately its price. To test the hypothesis, we merged datasets of Bitcoin prices and COVID - 19 cases and deaths. We also engineered extra features and applied statistical and machine learning (ML) models. We applied a Random Forest model (RF) to identify and rank the feature importance, and ran a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model on Bitcoin prices data set twice: with and without accounting for COVID - 19 related features.

Among these areas, Chemometrics has been benefited from the application of these algorithms in spectral data analysis. Commonly, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares are applied to spectral datasets to perform classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we present a 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to evaluate the effectiveness on spectral data obtained from spectroscopy. In most cases, the spectrum signals are noisy and present overlap among classes. Firstly, we perform extensive experiments including 1D-CNN compared to machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms used in Chemometrics on spectral data classification for the most known datasets available in the literature. Next, spectral samples of the SARS -COV2 virus, which causes the COVID - 19 , have recently been collected via spectroscopy was used as a case study. Experimental results indicate superior performance of 1D-CNN over machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms, obtaining an average accuracy of 96.5%, specificity of 98%, and sensitivity of 94%. The promissing obtained results indicate the feasibility to use 1D-CNN in automated systems to diagnose COVID - 19 and other viral diseases in the future. &#9651; Less Submitted 24 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

It helps with disease prevention, public health planning, and misinformation mitigation. However, creating such an information portal is challenging because 1) domain expertise is required to identify and curate credible and intelligible content, 2 ) the information needs to be updated promptly in response to the fast-changing environment, and 3) the information should be easily accessible by the general public; which is particularly difficult when most people do not have the domain expertise about the crisis. In this paper, we presented an expert-sourcing framework and created Jennifer, an AI chatbot, which serves as a credible and easy-to-access information portal for individuals during the COVID - 19 pandemic. Jennifer was created by a team of over 150 scientists and health professionals around the world, deployed in the real world and answered thousands of user questions about COVID - 19 . We evaluated Jennifer from two key stakeholders&#39; perspectives, expert volunteers and information seekers. We first interviewed experts who contributed to the collaborative creation of Jennifer to learn about the challenges in the process and opportunities for future improvement. We then conducted an online experiment that examined Jennifer&#39;s effectiveness in supporting information seekers in locating COVID - 19 information and gaining their trust. We share the key lessons learned and discuss design implications for building expert-sourced and AI-powered information portals, along with the risks and opportunities of misinformation mitigation and beyond. &#9651; Less Submitted 25 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

With the increasing number of COVID - 19 cases in the world, SARS - CoV - 2 has mutated into various variants. Given the increasingly dangerous conditions of the pandemic, it is crucial to know when the pandemic will stop by predicting confirmed cases of COVID - 19 . Therefore, many studies have raised COVID - 19 as a case study to overcome the ongoing pandemic using the Deep Learning method, namely LSTM, with reasonably accurate results and small error values. LSTM training is used to predict confirmed cases of COVID - 19 based on variants that have been identified using ECDC&#39;s COVID - 19 dataset containing confirmed cases of COVID - 19 that have been identified from 30 countries in Europe. Tests were conducted using the LSTM and BiLSTM models with the addition of RNN as comparisons on hidden size and layer size.

We propose CovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) that combines sensor and rhythmic features extracted from heart rate and activity (steps) data gathered passively using consumer-grade smart wearable to predict Covid - 19 . A total of 39 features were extracted (standard deviation, mean, min/max/avg length of sedentary and active bouts) from wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine parameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These features were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid - 19 in the incubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). A combination of sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of 0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity=0.89, F$_{0.1}$ = 0.76], outperforming prior approaches in discriminating Covid -positive patients from healthy controls using 24 hours of historical wearable physiological. Rhythmic features were the most predictive of Covid - 19 infection when utilized either alone or in conjunction with sensor features. Sensor features predicted healthy subjects best. Circadian rest-activity rhythms that combine 24h activity and sleep information were the most disrupted. CovidRhythm demonstrates that biobehavioral rhythms derived from consumer-grade wearable data can facilitate timely Covid - 19 detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to detect Covid - 19 using deep learning and biobehavioral rhythms features derived from consumer-grade wearable data. &#9651; Less Submitted 12 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.09322 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG Deep Learning-Based Assessment of Cerebral Microbleeds in COVID - 19 Authors: Neus Rodeja Ferrer , Malini Vendela Sagar , Kiril Vadimovic Klein , Christina Kruuse , Mads Nielsen , Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi Abstract : &hellip;as hypointensities from susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), are particularly important for the study of dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and normal aging. Recent studies on COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs), typically captured as hypointensities from susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), are particularly important for the study of dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and normal aging. Recent studies on COVID - 19 have shown an increase in CMBs of coronavirus cases. Automatic detection of CMBs is challenging due to the small size and amount of CMBs making the classes highly imbalanced, lack of publicly available annotated data, and similarity with CMB mimics such as calcifications, irons, and veins. Hence, the existing deep learning methods are mostly trained on very limited research data and fail to generalize to unseen data with high variability and cannot be used in clinical setups. To this end, we propose an efficient 3D deep learning framework that is actively trained on multi-domain data. Two public datasets assigned for normal aging, stroke, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease analysis as well as an in-house dataset for COVID - 19 assessment are used to train and evaluate the models.

However, the environment from real financial markets is complex and hard to be fully simulated, considering non-stationarity of the stock data, unpredictable hidden causal factors and so on. Fortunately, difference of stock prices is often stationary series, and the internal relationship between difference of stocks can be linked to the decision-making process, then the portfolio should be able to achieve better performance.

Our main focus is getting the profit and the probability of getting that profit using the differential evolution algorithm for vanilla option pricing on data before and during COVID - 19 pandemic. Therefore, we model the pricing of an option using a bi-objective optimization problem using data before and during COVID - 19 pandemic for one year expiration date. We change this problem into an optimization problem using adaptive weighted sum method. We use metaheuristics algorithm like Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to solve this bi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we also use modification of Differential Evolution for getting Pareto optimal solutions on vanilla option pricing for all contract. The algorithm is called Combinational Mutation Strategy of Differential Evolution (CmDE) algorithm. The results of our algorithm are satisfactory close to the real option price in the market data. Besides that, we also compare our result with the Black-Scholes results for validation. The results show that our results can approximate the real market options more accurate than Black-Scholes results. Hence, our bi-objective optimization using Combinational Mutation Strategy of Differential Evolution algorithm can be used to approximate the market real vanilla option pricing before and during COVID - 19 pandemic. &#9651; Less Submitted 22 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.09189 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; q-bio.QM Statistical reproducibility of meta-analysis research claims for medical mask use in community settings to prevent COVID infection Authors: S.

Many US states, cities, and counties implemented public orders for mask use on the notion that this intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and largely benefit public health outcomes. P-value plotting was used to evaluate statistical reproducibility of meta-analysis research claims of a benefit for medical (surgical) mask use in community settings to prevent COVID infection. Eight studies (seven meta-analyses, one systematic review) published between 1 January 2020 and 7 December 2022 were evaluated. Base studies were randomized control trials with outcomes of medical diagnosis or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of viral (Influenza or COVID ) illness. Self-reported viral illness outcomes were excluded because of awareness bias. No evidence was observed for a medical mask use benefit to prevent viral infections in six p-value plots (five meta-analyses and one systematic review). Research claims of no benefit in three meta-analyses and the systematic review were reproduced in p-value plots. Research claims of a benefit in two meta-analyses were not reproduced in p-value plots. Insufficient data were available to construct p-value plots for two meta-analyses because of overreliance on self-reported outcomes.

In the early stages of the pandemic, it was indeed advised to reduce the reuse and thus the recirculation of indoor air to minimize the risk of contamination through inhalation of virus-laden aerosol particles emitted by humans when coughing, sneezing, speaking or breathing. However, such recommendations are not compatible with energy saving requirements stemming from climate change and energy price increase concerns, especially in winter and summer when the fraction of outdoor air supplied to the building needs to be significantly heated or cooled down. In this experimental study, we aim at providing low-cost and low-energy solutions to modify the ventilation strategies currently used in many buildings to reduce the risk of respiratory disease transmission. We find that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) modules added to the HVAC system are very efficient at inactivating pathogens present in aerosols, leading to good indoor air quality even with significant indoor air recirculation. Moreover, we show that an optimal placement of the air exhaust vents relative to air supply vents can improve the ventilation efficiency, with significant consequences in terms of energy savings. &#9651; Less Submitted 29 January, 2023; v1 submitted 22 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Short-term forecasting can aid hospitals in adjusting their planning and freeing up beds in time. We created an easy-to-use online on-request tool based on local data to forecast COVID - 19 bed demand for individual hospitals. The tool is flexible and adaptable to different settings. It is based on a stochastic compartmental model for estimating the epidemic dynamics and coupled with an exponential smoothing model for forecasting. The models are written in R and Julia and implemented as an R-shiny dashboard. The model is parameterized using COVID - 19 incidence, vaccination, and bed occupancy data at customizable geographical resolutions, loaded from official online sources or uploaded manually. Users can select their hospital&#39;s catchment area and adjust the number of COVID - 19 occupied beds at the start of the simulation. The tool provides short-term forecasts of disease incidence and past and forecasted estimation of the epidemic reproductive number at the chosen geographical level. These quantities are then used to estimate the bed occupancy in both general wards and intensive care unit beds. The platform has proven efficient, providing results within seconds while coping with many concurrent users. By providing ad-hoc, local data informed forecasts, this platform allows decision-makers to evaluate realistic scenarios for allocating scarce resources, such as ICU beds, at various geographic levels. &#9651; Less Submitted 22 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

S. Islam , Naeem K. Janjua , Naveed Akhtar Abstract : &hellip;data classification problem is demonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale models, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID - 19 detection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer learning with the proposed method. &#9661; More Annotating medical images for disease detection is often tedious and expensive. Moreover, the available training samples for a given task are generally scarce and imbalanced. These conditions are not conducive for learning effective deep neural models. Hence, it is common to &#39;transfer&#39; neural networks trained on natural images to the medical image domain. However, this paradigm lacks in performance due to the large domain gap between the natural and medical image data. To address that, we propose a novel concept of Pre-text Representation Transfer (PRT). In contrast to the conventional transfer learning, which fine-tunes a source model after replacing its classification layers, PRT retains the original classification layers and updates the representation layers through an unsupervised pre-text task. The task is performed with (original, not synthetic) medical images, without utilizing any annotations. This enables representation transfer with a large amount of training data. This high-fidelity representation transfer allows us to use the resulting model as a more effective feature extractor. Moreover, we can also subsequently perform the traditional transfer learning with this model. We devise a collaborative representation based classification layer for the case when we leverage the model as a feature extractor. We fuse the output of this layer with the predictions of a model induced with the traditional transfer learning performed over our pre-text transferred model. The utility of our technique for limited and imbalanced data classification problem is demonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale models, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID - 19 detection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer learning with the proposed method. &#9651; Less Submitted 20 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

The feasibility of this estimation task is known as the practical identifiability (PI) problem. Here, we investigate the PI of eight commonly reported statistics of the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model using a new measure that shows how much a researcher can expect to learn in a model-based Bayesian analysis of prevalence data. Our findings show that the basic reproductive number and final outbreak size are often poorly identified, with learning exceeding that of individual model parameters only in the early stages of an outbreak. The peak intensity, peak timing, and initial growth rate are better identified, being in expectation over 20 times more probable having seen the data by the time the underlying outbreak peaks. We then test PI for a variety of true parameter combinations, and find that PI is especially problematic in slow-growing or less-severe outbreaks.

  Materials and Methods: The initial CXRs, clinical variables and outcomes (i.e., mortality, intubation, hospital length of stay, ICU admission) were collected from February 2020 to April 2020 with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results as the reference standard. The risk level was determined by the outcome. The fusion model was trained on 1657 patients (Age: 58.30 +/- 17.74; Female: 807) and validated on 428 patients (56.41 +/- 17.03; 190) from Northwestern Memorial HealthCare system and was tested on 439 patients (56.51 +/- 17.78; 205) from a single holdout hospital. Performance of pre-trained fusion models on full or partial modalities were compared on the test set using the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the McNemar test for accuracy, precision, recall and F1.
  Results: The accuracy of DeepCOVID-Fuse trained on CXRs and clinical variables is 0.658, with an AUC of 0.842, which significantly outperformed (p &lt; 0.05) models trained only on CXRs with an accuracy of 0.621 and AUC of 0.807 and only on clinical variables with an accuracy of 0.440 and AUC of 0.502.

  Conclusion: The fusion model learns better feature representations across different modalities during training and achieves good outcome predictions even when only some of the modalities are used in testing. &#9651; Less Submitted 20 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.08797 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; econ.GN When do Default Nudges Work?

This paper exploits regional variations in the roll-out of the Covid - 19 vaccine in Sweden to examine the effect of a nudge on groups whose intrinsic incentives are different: 16-17-year-olds, for whom Covid - 19 is not dangerous, and 50-59-year-olds, who face a substantial risk of death or severe disease. The response is strong in the younger but absent in the older age group, consistent with the theory that nudges work best for choices that are not meaningful to the individual. &#9651; Less Submitted 20 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

We build a framework to analyse the dynamics of non pharmaceutical interventions, to distinguish between mitigations measures leading to objective scientific improvements and mitigations based on both political and scientific considerations. We analyse two possible strategies within this framework. Namely, we consider mitigations driven by the limited resources of the health system and mitigations where a constant set of measures is applied at different moments. We describe the optimal interventions for these scenarios. Our approach is mathematical and involves sir differential systems, it is qualitative and geometrical rather than computational. Along with the analysis of these scenarios, we collect several results that may be useful on their own, in particular on the ground when the variables are not known in real time. &#9651; Less Submitted 20 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.08648 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.LG cs.AI STORM-GAN: Spatio-Temporal Meta-GAN for Cross-City Estimation of Human Mobility Responses to COVID - 19 Authors: Han Bao , Xun Zhou , Yiqun Xie , Yanhua Li , Xiaowei Jia Abstract : Human mobility estimation is crucial during the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Human mobility estimation is crucial during the COVID - 19 pandemic due to its significant guidance for policymakers to make non-pharmaceutical interventions. While deep learning approaches outperform conventional estimation techniques on tasks with abundant training data, the continuously evolving pandemic poses a significant challenge to solving this problem due to data nonstationarity, limited observations, and complex social contexts. Prior works on mobility estimation either focus on a single city or lack the ability to model the spatio-temporal dependencies across cities and time periods. To address these issues, we make the first attempt to tackle the cross-city human mobility estimation problem through a deep meta-generative framework. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Meta-Generative Adversarial Network (STORM-GAN) model that estimates dynamic human mobility responses under a set of social and policy conditions related to COVID - 19 . Facilitated by a novel spatio-temporal task-based graph (STTG) embedding, STORM-GAN is capable of learning shared knowledge from a spatio-temporal distribution of estimation tasks and quickly adapting to new cities and time periods with limited training samples. The STTG embedding component is designed to capture the similarities among cities to mitigate cross-task heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed approach can greatly improve estimation performance and out-perform baselines. &#9651; Less Submitted 20 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

The recruitment of trustworthy and high-quality workers is an important research issue for MCS. Previous studies assume that the qualities of workers are known in advance, or the platform knows the qualities of workers once it receives their collected data. In reality, to reduce their costs and thus maximize revenue, many strategic workers do not perform their sensing tasks honestly and report fake data to the platform. So, it is very hard for the platform to evaluate the authenticity of the received data. In this paper, an incentive mechanism named Semi-supervision based Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit reverse Auction (SCMABA) is proposed to solve the recruitment problem of multiple unknown and strategic workers in MCS. First, we model the worker recruitment as a multi-armed bandit reverse auction problem, and design an UCB-based algorithm to separate the exploration and exploitation, considering the Sensing Rates (SRs) of recruited workers as the gain of the bandit. Next, a Semi-supervised Sensing Rate Learning (SSRL) approach is proposed to quickly and accurately obtain the workers&#39; SRs, which consists of two phases, supervision and self-supervision. Last, SCMABA is designed organically combining the SRs acquisition mechanism with multi-armed bandit reverse auction, where supervised SR learning is used in the exploration, and the self-supervised one is used in the exploitation. We prove that our SCMABA achieves truthfulness and individual rationality. Additionally, we exhibit outstanding performances of the SCMABA mechanism through in-depth simulations of real-world data traces. &#9651; Less Submitted 17 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

In this study, we collected a dataset of over 24,000 images (from Wikidata/Wikipedia) of individuals who died of natural causes, along with the number of years between when the image was taken and when the person passed away. We made this dataset publicly available. We fine-tuned multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on this data, at best achieving a mean absolute error of 8.3 years in the validation data using VGGFace. However, the model&#39;s performance diminishes when the person was younger at the time of the image.

In this paper, we present a large-scale agent-based model of policy interventions that could have been implemented to mitigate the Omicron wave. Our model takes into account the behaviors of individuals and their interactions with one another within a nationally representative population, as well as the efficacy of various interventions such as social distancing, mask wearing, testing, tracing, and vaccination. We use the model to simulate the impact of different policy scenarios and evaluate their potential effectiveness in controlling the spread of the virus. Our results suggest the Omicron wave could have been substantially curtailed via a combination of interventions comparable in effectiveness to extreme and unpopular singular measures such as widespread closure of schools and workplaces, and highlight the importance of early and decisive action. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.08048 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; astro-ph.IM CRIRES$^{+}$ on sky at the ESO Very Large Telescope Authors: R.

Unfortunately, despite successes of (gold standard) retrospective studies of misinformation that confirmed their harmful effects after the fact, they arrive too late for timely intervention and reduction of such harm. By design, misinformation evades retrospective classifiers by exploiting two properties we call new-normal: (1) never-seen-before novelty that cause inescapable generalization challenges for previous classifiers, and ( 2 ) massive but short campaigns that end before they can be manually annotated for new classifier training. To tackle these challenges, we propose UFIT, which combines two techniques: semantic masking of strong signal keywords to reduce overfitting, and intra-proxy smoothness regularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve reliability and maintain accuracy. Evaluation of UFIT on public new-normal misinformation data shows over 30% improvement over existing approaches on future (and unseen) campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, UFIT is the first successful effort to achieve such high level of generalization on new-normal misinformation data with minimal concession (1 to 5%) of accuracy compared to oracles trained with full knowledge of all campaigns. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.07979 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; econ.GN Emerging Labour Flow Networks Authors: Kathyrn R.

To date, LFN models have relied upon an assumption of static network structure. However, as recent events (increasing automation in the workplace, the COVID - 19 pandemic, etc.) have shown, we are experiencing drastic shifts to the job landscape that are altering the ways individuals navigate the labour market. Here we develop a novel model that emerges LFNs from agent-level behaviour, removing the necessity of assuming that future job-to-job flows will be along the same paths where they have been historically observed. This model, informed by microdata for the United Kingdom, generates empirical LFNs with a high level of accuracy. We use the model to explore how shocks impacting the underlying distributions of jobs and wages alter the topology of the LFN. This framework represents a crucial step towards the development of models that can answer questions about the future of work in an ever-changing world. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.07951 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; q-bio.PE stat.AP doi 10.1016/j.chaos.2022.113093 Model-based assessment of sampling protocols for infectious disease genomic surveillance Authors: Sebastian Contreras , Karen Y.

However, due to the high costs associated with genomic sequencing, only a limited number of samples can be analysed. Thus, it is critical to understand how sampling impacts the information generated. Here, we combine a compartmental model for the spread of COVID - 19 (distinguishing several SARS - CoV - 2 variants) with different sampling strategies to assess their impact on genomic surveillance. In particular, we compare adaptive sampling, i.e., dynamically reallocating resources between screening at points of entry and inside communities, and constant sampling, i.e., assigning fixed resources to the two locations. We show that adaptive sampling uncovers new variants up to five weeks earlier than constant sampling, significantly reducing detection delays and estimation errors. This advantage is most prominent at low sequencing rates. Although increasing the sequencing rate has a similar effect, the marginal benefits of doing so may not always justify the associated costs. Consequently, it is convenient for countries with comparatively few resources to operate at lower sequencing rates, thereby profiting the most from adaptive sampling. Finally, our methodology can be readily adapted to study undersampling in other dynamical systems. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Using Bayesian modeling and the gender imbalance in COVID - 19 data, we attribute 840,000 (95% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) COVID - 19 cases across 12 countries to the championship. The impact depends non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number $R$, and the number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and England, where as much as 10,000 primary cases per million inhabitants occur from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in $R$ was 0.46 [0.18, 0.75] on match days, but important matches caused an increase as large as +3.

An early effective screening and grading become imperative towards optimizing the limited available resources of the medical facilities. Computed tomography (CT) provides a significant non-invasive screening mechanism for COVID - 19 infection. An automated segmentation of the infected volumes in lung CT is expected to significantly aid in the diagnosis and care of patients. However, an accurate demarcation of lesions remains problematic due to their irregular structure and location(s) within the lung. A novel deep learning architecture, Mixed Attention Deeply Supervised Network (MiADS-Net), is proposed for delineating the infected regions of the lung from CT images. Incorporating dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates, into a mixed attention framework, allows capture of multi-scale features towards improved segmentation of lesions having different sizes and textures. Mixed attention helps prioritise relevant feature maps to be probed, along with those regions containing crucial information within these maps. Deep supervision facilitates discovery of robust and discriminatory characteristics in the hidden layers at shallower levels, while overcoming the vanishing gradient. This is followed by estimating the severity of the disease, based on the ratio of the area of infected region in each lung with respect to its entire volume. Experimental results, on three publicly available datasets, indicate that the MiADS-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art architectures in the COVID - 19 lesion segmentation task; particularly in defining structures involving complex geometries. &#9651; Less Submitted 17 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.06660 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CL VaxxHesitancy: A Dataset for Studying Hesitancy Towards COVID - 19 Vaccination on Twitter Authors: Yida Mu , Mali Jin , Charlie Grimshaw , Carolina Scarton , Kalina Bontcheva , Xingyi Song Abstract : &hellip;of social media, people started to express their concerns about vaccines online alongside those posting pro- and anti-vaccine content.

Predictably, since the first mentions of a COVID - 19 vaccine, social media users posted about their fears and concerns or about their support and belief into the effectiveness of these rapidly developing vaccines. Identifying and understanding the reasons behind public hesitancy towards COVID - 19 vaccines is important for policy markers that need to develop actions to better inform the population with the aim of increasing vaccine take-up. In the case of COVID - 19 , where the fast development of the vaccines was mirrored closely by growth in anti-vaxx disinformation, automatic means of detecting citizen attitudes towards vaccination became necessary. This is an important computational social sciences task that requires data analysis in order to gain in-depth understanding of the phenomena at hand. Annotated data is also necessary for training data-driven models for more nuanced analysis of attitudes towards vaccination. To this end, we created a new collection of over 3,101 tweets annotated with users&#39; attitudes towards COVID - 19 vaccination (stance).

To this end, we present a dataset of 183 argumentative dialogues about 3 controversial topics: veganism, Brexit and COVID - 19 vaccination. The dialogues were collected using the Wizard of Oz approach, where wizards leverage a knowledge-base of arguments to converse with participants. Open-mindedness is measured before and after engaging in the dialogue using a questionnaire from the psychology literature, and success of the dialogue is measured as the change in the participant&#39;s stance towards those who hold opinions different to theirs. We evaluate two dialogue models: a Wikipedia-based and an argument-based model. We show that while both models perform closely in terms of opening up minds, the argument-based model is significantly better on other dialogue properties such as engagement and clarity. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

In this work, we give priority to data-driven approaches and choose to avoid a priori and ad-hoc methods. We introduce a generalised family of epidemiologically informed mechanistic models, guided by Ordinary Differential Equations and embedded in a probabilistic model. The mechanistic models SIKR and SEMIKR with K Infectious and M Exposed sub-compartments (resulting in non-exponential infectious and exposed periods) are enriched with a time-dependent transmission rate, parametrized using Bayesian P-splines. This enables an extensive flexibility in the transmission dynamics, with no ad-hoc intervention, while maintaining good differentiability properties. Our probabilistic model relies on the solutions of the mechanistic model and benefits from access to the information about under-reporting of new infected cases, a crucial property when studying diseases with a large fraction of asymptomatic infections. Such a model can be efficiently differentiated, which facilitates the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for sampling from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The features and advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comparison with state-of-the-art methods using a synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we successfully apply our methodology to the study of the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 in the Basque Country (Spain) for almost a year, from mid February 2020 to the end of January 2021. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

This paper incorporates a techno-economic analysis of energy storage systems to investigate the pandemic&#39;s influence on ESS development, In particular, we employ a linear program-based revenue maximization model to capture the revenues of ESS from participating in the electricity market, by performing arbitrage on energy trading, and regulation market, by providing regulation services to stabilize the grid&#39;s frequency. We consider five dominant energy storage technologies in the U.S., namely, Lithium-ion, Advanced Lead Acid, Flywheel, Vanadium Redox Flow, and Lithium-Iron Phosphate storage technologies. Extensive numerical results conducted on the case of New York City allow us to highlight the negative impact that COVID - 19 had on the NYC power sector. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.06238 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CR Supporting Secure Dynamic Alert Zones Using Searchable Encryption and Graph Embedding Authors: Sina Shaham , Gabriel Ghinita , Cyrus Shahabi Abstract : Location-based alerts have gained increasing popularity in recent years, whether in the context of healthcare (e.g., COVID - 19 contact tracing), marketing (e.g., location-based advertising), or public safety.

However, serious privacy concerns arise when location data are used in clear in the process. Several solutions employ Searchable Encryption (SE) to achieve secure alerts directly on encrypted locations. While doing so preserves privacy, the performance overhead incurred is high. We focus on a prominent SE technique in the public-key setting -- Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE), and propose a graph embedding technique to encode location data in a way that significantly boosts the performance of processing on ciphertexts. We show that finding the optimal encoding is NP-hard, and provide several heuristics that are fast and obtain significant performance gains. Furthermore, we investigate the more challenging case of dynamic alert zones, where the area of interest changes over time. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our solutions can significantly improve computational overhead compared to existing baselines. &#9651; Less Submitted 15 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.05818 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; physics.flu-dyn physics.med-ph Numerical investigation of airborne transmission in low-ceiling rooms under displacement ventilation Authors: Changchang Wang , Jiarong Hong Abstract : This study employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the risk of airborne transmission of COVID - 19 in low-ceiling rooms, such as elevator cabins, under mechanical displacement ventilation.

The simulations take into account the effects of the human body&#39;s thermal environment and respiratory jet dynamics on the transmission of pathogens. The results of the study are used to propose a potential mitigation strategy based on ventilation thermal control to reduce the risk of airborne transmission in these types of enclosed indoor spaces. Our findings demonstrate that as the ventilation rate (Qv) increases, the efficiency of removing airborne particles (Ep) initially increases rapidly, reaches a plateau (Ep,c) at a critical ventilation rate (Qc), and subsequently increases at a slower rate beyond Qc. The Qc for low-ceiling rooms is lower compared to high-ceiling rooms due to the increased interaction between the thermal plume generated by the occupants or infectors and the ventilation. Further analysis of the flow and temperature fields reveals that Ep is closely linked to the thermal stratification fields, as characterized by the thermal interface height, the height of the temperature isosurface, and temperature gradient. The simulations also indicate that the location of infector relative to ventilation inlet/outlet affects Qc and Ep,c with higher Qc and lower Ep,c observed when infector is in a corner due to potential formation of a local hot spot of high infection risk when infector is near the ventilation inlet. In conclusion, based on the simulations, we propose a ventilation thermal control strategy, by increasing the ventilation temperature, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission in low-ceiling rooms. Our findings indicate that the thermal environment plays a critical role in the transmission of airborne diseases confined spaces. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

The mass transition to remote work amid the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Background. The mass transition to remote work amid the COVID - 19 pandemic profoundly affected software professionals, who abruptly shifted into ostensibly temporary home offices. The effects of this transition on these professionals are complex, depending on the particularities of the context and individuals. Recent studies advocate for remote structures to create opportunities for many equity-deserving groups; however, remote work can also be challenging for some individuals, such as women and individuals with disabilities. Objective. This study aims to investigate the effects of remote work on LGBTQIA+ software professionals. Method. Grounded theory methodology was applied based on information collected from two main sources: a survey questionnaire with a sample of 57 LGBTQIA+ software professionals and nine follow-up interviews with individuals from this sample. This sample included professionals of different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and levels of experience. Findings. Our findings demonstrate that (1) remote work benefits LGBTQIA+ people by increasing security and visibility; ( 2 ) remote work harms LGBTQIA+ software professionals through isolation and invisibility; (3) the benefits outweigh the drawbacks; (4) the drawbacks can be mitigated by supportive measures developed by software companies. Conclusion. This paper investigated how remote work can affect LGBTQIA+ software professionals and presented a set of recommendations on how software companies can address the benefits and limitations associated with this work model. In summary, we concluded that remote work is crucial in increasing diversity and inclusion in the software industry. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 February, 2023; v1 submitted 12 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

The effective rate of policies was measured by the difference between the predicted daily infection proportion rate using the data before the policy and the actual daily infection proportion rate. The study suggests that both mask and vaccine policy had a significant impact on mitigating the pandemic. We further explored how different social factors influenced the effectiveness of a specific policy through the linear regression model. Out of 9 factors, the population density, number of hospital beds per 1000 people, and percent of the population over 65 are the most substantial factors on mask policy effectiveness, while public health funding per person, percent of immigration have the most significant influence on vaccine policy effectiveness. This study summarized the effectiveness of different policies and factors they associated with.

As has been well studied, naive regression neither properly accounts for community structure, nor does it account for the dependent variable acting as both model outcome and covariate. To address this methodological gap, we propose a network regression model motivated by the important observation that controlling for community structure can, when a network is modular, significantly account for meaningful correlation between observations induced by network connections. We propose a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to learn model parameters based on clusters defined through any single-membership community detection algorithm applied to the observed network. We provide a necessary condition on the network size and edge formation probabilities to establish the asymptotic normality of the model parameters under the assumption that the graph structure is a stochastic block model. We evaluate the performance of our approach through simulations and apply it to estimate the joint impact of baseline covariates and network effects on COVID - 19 incidence rate among countries connected by a network of commercial airline traffic. We find that during the beginning of the pandemic the network effect has some influence, the percentage of urban population has more influence on the incidence rate compared to the network effect after the travel ban was in effect. &#9651; Less Submitted 11 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Chen Abstract : In the context of continued spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (&hellip; &#9661; More In the context of continued spread of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by SARS - CoV - 2 and the emergence of new variants, the demand for rapid, accurate, and frequent detection is increasing. Besides, the new predominant strain, Omicron variant, manifests more similar clinical features to those of other common respiratory infections. The concurrent detection of multiple potential pathogens helps distinguish SARS - CoV - 2 infection from other diseases with overlapping symptoms, which is significant for patients to receive tailored treatment and containing the outbreak. Here, we report a lab-on-a-chip biosensing platform for SARS - CoV - 2 detection based on subwavelength grating micro-ring resonator. The sensing surface is functionalized by specific antibody against SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein, which could produce redshifts of resonant peaks by antigen-antibody combination, thus achieving quantitative detection. Additionally, the sensor chip is integrated with a microfluidic chip with an anti-backflow Y-shaped structure that enables the concurrent detection of two analytes. In this study, we realized the detection and differentiation of COVID - 19 and influenza A H1N1. Experimental results show that the limit of detection of our device reaches 100 fg/mL (1.31 fM) within 15 min detecting time, and cross-reactivity tests manifest the specificity of the optical diagnostic assay. Further, the integrated packaging and streamlined workflow facilitate its use for clinical applications. Thus, the biosensing platform offers a promising solution to achieve ultrasensitive, selective, multiplexed, and quantitative point-of-care detection of COVID - 19 . &#9651; Less Submitted 11 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.04607 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; econ.GN doi 10.3390/socsci11110522 The Impact of National Culture on Innovation A Comparative Analysis between Developed and Developing Nations during the Pre and Post Crisis Period 2007_2021 Authors: Han-Sol Lee , Sergey U.

The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of cultural factors on the innovation development for different income groups during the pre- and post-crisis period. We found that, in general, the same cultural properties were required for countries to enhance innovation inputs and outputs regardless of pre- and post-crisis periods and time variances. The significant cultural factors (driving forces) of the innovation performance do not change over time. However, our empirical results revealed that not the crisis itself but the income group (either developed or developing) is the factor that influences the relationship between cultural properties and innovation. It is also worth noting that cultural properties have lost much of their impact on innovation, particularly in developing countries, during recent periods. It is highly likely that in terms of innovation, no cultural development or change can significantly impact the innovation output of developing countries without the construction of the appropriate systems. &#9651; Less Submitted 26 December, 2022; originally announced January 2023.

In B5G/6G need for low latency, the infrastructure should be reconfigurable and intelligent to be able to work in real time and interoperable with the existing wireless network. It has a drastic impact on the society due to its high precision, accuracy, reliability and efficiency and the ability to connect a user from far away or remote areas. Such a touch-enabled interaction is primarily concerned with the real time transmission of the tactile based haptic information over the internet, in addition to the usual audio, visual and data traffic, thus enabling a paradigm shift towards establishing a real time control and steering communication system. The existing system latency and overhead creates delays and limits the usability of the future applications. This study proposes an intelligent touch-enabled system for B5G/6G and IoT based wireless communication network that incorporates the AR/VR technologies. The tactile internet and network slicing serve as the backbone of the touch technology which incorporates intelligence from techniques such as AI/ML/DL. The survey introduces a layered and interfacing architecture complete with its E2E solution for the intelligent touch based wireless communication system. It is anticipated for the next generation system to provide numerous opportunities for various sectors utilizing AR/VR technology in robotics and healthcare facilities, all with the intention of helping in addressing severe problems faced by the society.

However, the robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of its adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is NP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original sequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or thousands of residues) in the given protein sequence. In our experimental evaluation, we consider 111 COVID - 19 proteins in the Universal Protein resource (UniProt), a central resource for protein data managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the US Protein Information Resource. These result in an overall GDT similarity test score average of around 34%, demonstrating a substantial drop in the performance of AlphaFold. &#9651; Less Submitted 12 January, 2023; v1 submitted 10 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Their quality is affected by various factors and their relationship with epidemiological indicators varies over time. Here we adopt a model-free approach based on transfer entropy to quantify the relationship between mobile phone-derived mobility metrics and COVID - 19 cases and deaths in more than 200 European subnational regions. We found that past knowledge of mobility does not provide statistically significant information on COVID - 19 cases or deaths in most of the regions. In the remaining ones, measures of contact rates were often more informative than movements in predicting the spread of the disease, while the most predictive metrics between mid-range and short-range movements depended on the region considered. We finally identify geographic and demographic factors, such as users&#39; coverage and commuting patterns, that can help determine the best metric for predicting disease incidence in a particular location. Our approach provides epidemiologists and public health officials with a general framework to evaluate the usefulness of human mobility data in responding to epidemics. &#9651; Less Submitted 10 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.03878 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; q-bio.BM doi 10.1093/bib/bbac567 Critical review of conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods Authors: Gabriel Cia , Fabrizio Pucci , Marianne Rooman Abstract : &hellip;used consensus strategies that combine the results from multiple webservers are at best only marginally better than random.

The results of our assessment and statistical analyses show that all the methods achieve very low performances, and some do not perform better than randomly generated patches of surface residues.

In this study we investigate weighted exposure-networks of human daily activities in the capital region of Finland as a proxy for contacts between postal code areas during the pre-pandemic year 2019 and pandemic years 2020, 2021 and early 2022. We investigate the suitability of gravity and radiation type models for reconstructing the exposure-networks based on geo-spatial and population mobility information. For this we use a mobile phone dataset of aggregated daily visits from a postal code area to cellphone grid locations, and treat it as a bipartite network to create weighted one mode projections using a weighted co-occurrence function. We fit a gravitation model and a radiation model to the averaged weekly and yearly projection networks with geo-spatial and socioeconomic variables of the postal code areas and their populations. We also consider an extended gravity type model comprising of additional postal area information such as distance via public transportation and population density. The results show that the co-occurrence of human activities, or exposure, between postal code areas follows both the gravity and radiation type interactions, once fitted to the empirical network. The effects of the pandemic beginning in 2020 can be observed as a decrease of the overall activity as well as of the exposure of the projected networks. In general, the results show that the postal code level networks changed to be more proximity weighted after the pandemic began, following the government imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions, with differences based on the geo-spatial and socioeconomic structure of the areas. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

However, staff scheduling is sometimes affected by unexpected events, such as the COVID - 19 pandemic, that disrupt regular operations. Since infectious diseases like COVID - 19 transmit mainly through close contact with individuals, an efficient way to prevent the spread is by limiting the number of on-site employees in the workplace along with regular testing. Thus, determining an optimal scheduling and testing strategy that meets the organization&#39;s goals and prevents the spread of the virus is crucial during disease outbreaks. In this paper, we formulate these challenges in the framework of two Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) models. The first model aims to derive optimal staff occupancy and testing strategies to minimize the risk of infection among employees, while the second model aims at only optimal staff occupancy under a random testing strategy. To solve the problems expressed in the models, we propose a canonical genetic algorithm as well as two commercial solvers. Using both real and synthetic contact networks of employees, our results show that following the recommended occupancy and testing strategy reduces the risk of infection 25\%--60\% under different scenarios. &#9651; Less Submitted 6 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Heterogeneity in messages effectiveness by just world beliefs Authors: Juliane Wiese , Nattavudh Powdthavee Abstract : To end the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More To end the COVID - 19 pandemic, policymakers have relied on various public health messages to boost vaccine take-up rates amongst people across wide political spectra, backgrounds, and worldviews. However, much less is understood about whether these messages affect different people in the same way. One source of heterogeneity is the belief in a just world (BJW), which is the belief that in general, good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people. This study investigates the effectiveness of two common messages of the COVID - 19 pandemic: vaccinate to protect yourself and vaccinate to protect others in your community. We then examine whether BJW moderates the effectiveness of these messages. We hypothesize that just-world believers react negatively to the prosocial pro-vaccine message, as it charges individuals with the responsibility to care for others around them. Using an unvaccinated sample of UK residents before vaccines were made widely available (N=526), we demonstrate that the individual-focused message significantly reduces overall vaccine skepticism, and that this effect is more robust for individuals with a low BJW, whereas the community-focused message does not. Our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in the reception of public health messages to reduce COVID - 19 vaccine skepticism. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.03124 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; econ.GN The COVID - 19 vaccination, preventive behaviors and pro-social motivation: panel data analysis from Japan Authors: Eiji Yamamura , Yoshiro Tsutsui , Fumio Ohtake Abstract : The COVID - 19 vaccine reduces infection risk: even if one contracts COVID - 19 , the probability of complications like death or hospitalization is lower.

However, vaccination may prompt people to decrease preventive behaviors, such as staying indoors, handwashing, and wearing a mask. Thereby, if vaccinated people pursue only their self-interest, the vaccine&#39;s effect may be lower than expected. However, if vaccinated people are pro-social (motivated toward benefit for the whole society), they might maintain preventive behaviors to reduce the spread of infection. &#9651; Less Submitted 8 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.03029 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CL cs.SI Topic Modelling of Swedish Newspaper Articles about Coronavirus : a Case Study using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method Authors: Bernadeta Griciūtė , Lifeng Han , Hao Li , Goran Nenadic Abstract : &hellip;study, from the social-media and healthcare domain, we apply popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods to model the topic changes in Swedish newspaper articles about Coronavirus .

Climate change is at the root of many recent natural hazards while the COVID - 19 pandemic is still an active threat. Social vulnerability also refers to resilience, or the ability to recover from such adverse events. To gauge the many aspects of social vulnerability the US Center of Disease Control (CDC) has subdivided social vulnerabilities into distinct themes, such as socioeconomic status, household composition, and others. Knowing a community&#39;s social vulnerabilities can help policymakers and responders to recognize risks to community health, prepare for possible hazards, or recover from disasters. In this paper we study social vulnerabilities on the US county level and present research that suggests that there are certain combinations, or patterns, of social vulnerability indicators into which US counties can be grouped. We then present an interactive dashboard that allows analysts to explore these patterns in various ways. We demonstrate our methodology using COVID - 19 death rate as the hazard and show that the patterns we identified have high predictive capabilities of the pandemic&#39;s local impact. &#9651; Less Submitted 7 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.02893 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.CY cs.IR MangngalApp -- An integrated package of technology for COVID - 19 response and rural development: Acceptability and usability using TAM Authors: Billy S.

Numerous people have perished due to inaccurate COVID - 19 identification and, consequently, a lack of appropriate medical treatment. Numerous solutions based on manual and automatic feature extraction techniques have been investigated to address this issue by researchers worldwide. Typically, automatic feature extraction methods, particularly deep learning models, necessitate a powerful hardware system to perform the necessary computations. Unfortunately, many institutions and societies cannot benefit from these advancements due to the prohibitively high cost of high-quality hardware equipment. As a result, this study focused on two primary goals: first, lowering the computational costs associated with running the proposed model on embedded devices, mobile devices, and conventional computers; and second, improving the model&#39;s performance in comparison to previously published methods (at least performs on par with state-of-the-art models) in order to ensure its performance and accuracy for the medical recognition task. This study used two neural networks to improve feature extraction from our dataset: VGG19 and ResNet50V2. Both of these networks are capable of providing semantic features from the nominated dataset. To this end, An alternative network was considered, namely MobileNetV2, which excels at extracting semantic features while requiring minimal computation on mobile and embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) was used to transfer knowledge from the teacher network (concatenated ResNet50V2 and VGG19) to the student network (MobileNetV2) to improve MobileNetV2 performance and to achieve a robust and accurate model for the COVID - 19 identification task from chest X-ray images. &#9651; Less Submitted 6 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

Video lectures and web-based virtual experiments were utilized to provide students enrolled in these laboratories with required learning materials on a weekly basis. During the fall semester of the 2021-2022 academic year, optional Kahoot! quizzes were offered in addition, serving to incentivize participation and to provide self-efficacy opportunities to students. This study sought to explore the intersection of self-efficacy growth, self-regulatory behaviors, and intelligence mindsets (i.e., having fixed or growth mindsets) for students and to examine the impact of these remote learning methods. Using a modified version of the Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science Survey (CLASS), students&#39; physics self-efficacy was measured at the beginning and end of the semester. The analysis revealed that participation in Kahoot! alone did not correspond to greater self-efficacy scores or greater self-efficacy change. However, a strong correlation was observed between intelligence mindset and self-efficacy for both pre-and post-surveys. Pre-survey intelligence mindset scores were not related to average Kahoot! performance, while post-survey intelligence mindsets were. Finally, positive self-efficacy change $\langle c \rangle$ was measured for the class, but was not statistically significant. &#9651; Less Submitted 6 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

The vitamin D status of the population has been found to be an important factor that could influence outcome of COVID - 19 . However, whether vitamin D can lessen the symptoms or severity of COVID - 19 still remains controversial. Methods: A total of 719 patients with confirmed COVID - 19 were enrolled retrospectively in this study from April 13 to June 6, 2022 at Shanghai Forth People&#39;s Hospital. The circulating levels of 25(OH)D3, inflammatory factors, and clinical parameters were assayed. Time to viral RNA clearance (TVRC), classification and prognosis of COVID - 19 were used to evaluate the severity of COVID - 19 infection. Results: The median age was 76 years (interquartile range, IQR, 64.5-84.6), 44.1% of patients were male, and the TVRC was 11 days (IQR, 7-16) in this population. The median level of 25(OH)D3 was 27.15 (IQR, 19.31-38.89) nmol/L. Patients with lower serum 25(OH)D3 had prolonged time to viral clearance, more obvious inflammatory response, more severe respiratory symptoms and higher risks of impaired hepatic and renal function. Multiple regression analyses revealed that serum 25(OH)D3 level was negatively associated with TVRC independently. ROC curve showed the serum vitamin D level could predict the severity classification and prognosis of COVID - 19 significantly.Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D3 level is independently associated with the severity of COVID - 19 in elderly, and it could be used as a predictor of the severity of COVID - 19 . In addition, supplementation with vitamin D might provide beneficial effects in old patients with COVID - 19 . &#9651; Less Submitted 25 December, 2022; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.02594 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; stat.AP Modeling Virus Transmission Risks in Commuting with Emerging Mobility Services: A Case Study of COVID - 19 Authors: Baichuan Mo , Peyman Noursalehi , Haris N.

With the gradual recovery from COVID - 19 and more people returning to work from the office, the transmission of COVID - 19 during commuting becomes a concern. Recent emerging mobility services (such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing) further deteriorate the infection risks due to shared vehicles or spaces during travel. Hence, it is important to quantify the infection risks in commuting. This paper proposes a probabilistic framework to estimate the risk of infection during an individual&#39;s commute considering different travel modes, including public transit, ride-share, bike, and walking. The objective is to evaluate the probability of infection as well as the estimation errors (i.e., uncertainty quantification) given the origin-destination (OD), departure time, and travel mode. We first define a general trip planning function to generate trip trajectories and probabilities of choosing different paths according to the OD, departure time, and travel mode. Then, we consider two channels of infections: 1) infection by close contact and 2 ) infection by touching surfaces. The infection risks are calculated on a trip segment basis. Different sources of data (such as smart card data, travel surveys, and population data) are used to estimate the potential interactions between the individual and the infectious environment. The model is implemented in the MIT community as a case study. We evaluate the commute infection risks for employees and students. Results show that most of the individuals have an infection probability close to zero. The maximum infection probability is around 0.8%, implying that the probability of getting infected during the commuting process is low. Individuals with larger travel distances, traveling in transit, and traveling during peak hours are more likely to get infected. &#9651; Less Submitted 6 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.02542 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; physics.optics physics.bio-ph Label-free single nanoparticle identification and characterization including infectious emergent virus Authors: Minh-Chau Nguyen , Peter Bonnaud , Rayane Dibsy , Guillaume Maucort , Sébastien Lyonnais , Delphine Muriaux , Pierre Bon Abstract : &hellip;laboratories.

By auditing the complete set of COVID - 19 -related publications in the Web of Science, we reveal here that COVID - 19 -related research worsened the polarization of academic journals: the IF before the pandemic was proportional to the increment of IF, which had the effect of increasing inequality while retaining the journal rankings. We also found that the most highly cited studies related to COVID - 19 were published in prestigious journals at the onset of the epidemic, independent of their innate importance or quality.

As universities raced to implement emergency remote teaching (ERT) strategies in Japan, some have explored innovative interventions other than webinar platforms and learning management systems to bridge the gap caused by restricted mobility among teachers and learners. One such innovation is virtual reality (VR). VR has been changing the landscape of higher education because of its ability to &#34;teleport&#34; learners to various places by simulating real-world environments in the virtual world. Some teachers, including the authors of this paper, explored integrating VR into their activities to address issues caused by geographical limitations brought about by the heightened restrictions in 2020. Results were largely encouraging. However, rules started relaxing in the succeeding years as more people got vaccinated. Thus, some fully online classes in Japan shifted to blended learning as they moved toward fully returning to in-person classes prompting educators to modify how they implemented their VR-based interventions. This paper describes how a class of university students in Japan who were taking a Filipino language course experienced a VR-based intervention in blended mode, which was originally prototyped during the peak of the ERT era. Moreover, adjustments and comparisons regarding methodological idiosyncrasies and findings between the fully online iteration and the recently implemented blended one are reported in detail. &#9651; Less Submitted 4 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

As a cheap and widely accessible medical image modality, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging allows radiologists to identify symptoms and assess severity through visual inspection of the chest ultrasound images. Combined with the recent advancements in computer science, applications of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis have shown promising results, demonstrating that artificial intelligence-based solutions can accelerate the diagnosis of COVID - 19 and lower the burden on healthcare professionals.

Medicalized hotels were established in Taiwan as quarantine facilities for COVID - 19 patients with no or mild symptoms. Due to limited medical care available at these hotels, it is of paramount importance to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a graph-based deep learning approach for progressive hospital transfer risk prediction in a medicalized hotel setting. Vital sign measurements were obtained for 632 patients and daily patient similarity graphs were constructed. Inductive graph convolutional network models were trained on top of the temporally integrated graphs to predict hospital transfer risk. The proposed models achieved AUC scores above 0.83 for hospital transfer risk prediction based on the measurements of past 1, 2 , and 3 days, outperforming baseline machine learning methods. A post-hoc analysis on the constructed diffusion-based graph using Local Clustering Coefficient discovered a high-risk cluster with significantly older mean age, higher body temperature, lower SpO2, and shorter length of stay. Further time-to-hospital-transfer survival analysis also revealed a significant decrease in survival probability in the discovered high-risk cluster. The obtained results demonstrated promising predictability and interpretability of the proposed graph-based approach. This technique may help preemptively detect high-risk patients at community-based medical facilities similar to a medicalized hotel. &#9651; Less Submitted 31 December, 2022; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.01277 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; econ.GN doi 10.24818/EA/2021/56/155 Consumer acceptance of the use of artificial intelligence in online shopping: evidence from Hungary Authors: Szabolcs Nagy , Noemi Hajdu Abstract : &hellip;of technology has drastically changed the way consumers do their shopping.

The volume of global online commerce has significantly been increasing partly due to the recent COVID - 19 crisis that has accelerated the expansion of e-commerce. A growing number of webshops integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), state-of-the-art technology into their stores to improve customer experience, satisfaction and loyalty. However, little research has been done to verify the process of how consumers adopt and use AI-powered webshops. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical background, this study addresses the question of trust and consumer acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in online retail. An online survey in Hungary was conducted to build a database of 439 respondents for this study. To analyse data, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used. After the respecification of the initial theoretical model, a nested model, which was also based on TAM, was developed and tested.

A timely exchange of information related to the spread of novel pathogens, stay-at-home orders, and other containment measures can be effective at containing an infectious disease, particularly during in the early stages when testing infrastructure, vaccines, and other medical interventions may not be available at scale. Using a multiplex epidemic model that consists of an information layer (modeling information exchange between individuals) and a spatially embedded epidemic layer (representing a human contact network), we study how random and targeted disruptions in the information layer (\eg, errors and intentional attacks on communication infrastructure) impact outbreak dynamics. We calibrate our model to the early outbreak stages of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in 2020. Mitigation campaign can still be effective under random disruptions, such as failure of information channels between a few individuals. However, targeted disruptions or sabotage of hub nodes that exchange information with a large number of individuals can abruptly change outbreak characteristics such as the time to reach the peak infection. Our results emphasize the importance of using a robust communication infrastructure that can withstand both random and targeted disruptions. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023.

We use RIFL to perform federated learning of mortality risk for patients hospitalized with COVID - 19 using real-world EHR data from 16 healthcare centers representing 275 hospitals across four countries. &#9661; More Synthesizing information from multiple data sources is critical to ensure knowledge generalizability. Integrative analysis of multi-source data is challenging due to the heterogeneity across sources and data-sharing constraints due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we consider a general robust inference framework for federated meta-learning of data from multiple sites, enabling statistical inference for the prevailing model, defined as the one matching the majority of the sites. Statistical inference for the prevailing model is challenging since it requires a data-adaptive mechanism to select eligible sites and subsequently account for the selection uncertainty. We propose a novel sampling method to address the additional variation arising from the selection. Our devised CI construction does not require sites to share individual-level data and is shown to be valid without requiring the selection of eligible sites to be error-free. The proposed robust inference for federated meta-learning (RIFL) methodology is broadly applicable and illustrated with three inference problems: aggregation of parametric models, high-dimensional prediction models, and inference for average treatment effects. We use RIFL to perform federated learning of mortality risk for patients hospitalized with COVID - 19 using real-world EHR data from 16 healthcare centers representing 275 hospitals across four countries. &#9651; Less Submitted 2 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.00629 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.AI stat.ML Learning and interpreting asymmetry-labeled DAGs: a case study on COVID - 19 fear Authors: Manuele Leonelli , Gherardo Varando Abstract : &hellip;the underlying dependence structure.

Accordingly, this study investigates the features of social tipping in online communities and examines the correlations between the tipping features and characteristics of online communities. Taking the side effects of COVID - 19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns of tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain Algorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020 and April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the correlations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find that social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months and lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in online communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social tipping is positively related to the community populations and original acceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration and the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network modularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships with the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality can have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping. Our findings shed light on more precise normative interventions on misinformation in digital environments as it offers preliminary evidence about the timing and mechanism of social norm emergence. &#9651; Less Submitted 1 January, 2023; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.00117 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; physics.soc-ph cs.LG cs.SI Adapting Node-Place Model to Predict and Monitor COVID - 19 Footprints and Transmission Risks Authors: Jiali Zhou , Mingzhi Zhou , Jiangping Zhou , Zhan Zhao Abstract : &hellip;development.

This article adapts this model to investigate whether and how node, place, and mobility would be associated with the transmission risks and presences of the local COVID - 19 cases in a city. Similar studies on the model and its relevance to COVID - 19 , according to our knowledge, have not been undertaken before. Moreover, the unique metric drawn from detailed visit history of the infected, i.e., the COVID - 19 footprints, is proposed and exploited. This study then empirically uses the adapted model to examine the station-level factors affecting the local COVID - 19 footprints. The model accounts for traditional measures of the node and place as well as actual human mobility patterns associated with the node and place. It finds that stations with high node, place, and human mobility indices normally have more COVID - 19 footprints in proximity. A multivariate regression is fitted to see whether and to what degree different indices and indicators can predict the COVID - 19 footprints. The results indicate that many of the place, node, and human mobility indicators significantly impact the concentration of COVID - 19 footprints. These are useful for policy-makers to predict and monitor hotspots for COVID - 19 and other pandemics transmission. &#9651; Less Submitted 30 December, 2022; originally announced January 2023. arXiv:2301.00096 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.IR doi 10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V70I12P226 Sentiment Analysis of COVID - 19 Public Activity Restriction (PPKM) Impact using BERT Method Authors: Fransiscus , A.

This study aims to analyze the mapping of public sentiment towards PPKM policies in Indonesia during the pandemic based on Twitter data. Knowing the mapping of public sentiment regarding PPKM is expected to help stakeholders in the policy evaluation process for each region. The method used is BERT with IndoBERT specific model.

We leverage USPTO patent application data to investigate and quantify the disturbance. We assess differences by field of technology (at the CPC subclass level) as well as the impact of direct and indirect relevance for the management of the pandemic. Direct Covid - 19 relevance is identified from a keyword search of the patent application fulltexts; indirect Covid - 19 relevance is derived from past CPC subclass to subclass citation patterns. We find that direct Covid - 19 relevance is associated with a strong boost to the growth of the number of patent applications in the first year of the pandemic at the same order of magnitude (in percentage points) as the percentage of patents referencing Covid - 19 . We find no effect for indirect Covid - 19 relevance, indicating a focus on applied research at the expense of more basic research.

However, research on dangerous viruses can only be performed in certified laboratories that follow strict safety procedures. Thus, developing deactivated virus constructs or safe-to-use virus-like objects, which imitate real viruses and allow performing virus-related studies in any research laboratory, constitutes an important scientific challenge. One of the groups of such species are the so-called virus-like particles (VLPs). Instead of capsids with viral DNA/RNA, VLPs have synthetic cores with real virus proteins attached to them. We have developed a method for the preparation of VLPs imitating the virus responsible for the COVID - 19 disease: the SARS - CoV - 2 . The particles have Au cores surrounded by &#34;coronas&#34; of S1 domains of the virus&#39;s Spike protein. Importantly, they are safe to use and specifically interact with SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies. Moreover, Au cores exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which makes the synthesized VLPs suitable for biosensing applications. Within our studies, the effect allowed us to visualize the interaction between the VLPs and the antibodies and identify the characteristic vibrational signals. What is more, additional functionalization of the particles with a fluorescent label revealed their potential in studying specific virus-related interactions. Notably, the universal character of the developed synthesis method makes it potentially applicable for fabricating VLPs imitating other life-threatening viruses. &#9651; Less Submitted 27 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.13993 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CR eess.SY Metaverse Communications, Networking, Security, and Applications: Research Issues, State-of-the-Art, and Future Directions Authors: Mansoor Ali , Faisal Naeem , Georges Kaddoum , Ekram Hossain Abstract : &hellip;reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.

For vaccine-preventable diseases, outstanding issues like vaccine hesitancy and availability of vaccines further lead to nonuniform coverage among groups, not to mention the efficacy of vaccines and the mixing pattern varying from one group to another. As the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic transitions to endemicity, it is of interest and significance to understand the impact of aforementioned population heterogeneity on the emergence and persistence of epidemics. Here we analyze epidemic thresholds and characterize bifurcation dynamics by accounting for heterogeneity caused by group-dependent characteristics, including vaccination rate and efficacy as well as disease transmissibility. Our analysis shows that increases in the difference in vaccination coverage among groups can render multiple equilibria of disease burden to exist even if the overall basic reproductive ratio is below one (also known as backward bifurcation). The presence of other heterogeneity factors such as differences in vaccine efficacy, transmission, mixing pattern, and group size can each exhibit subtle impacts on bifurcation. We find that heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy can undermine the condition for backward bifurcations whereas homophily tends to aggravate disease endemicity. Our results have practical implications for improving public health efforts by addressing the role of population heterogeneity in the spread and control of diseases. &#9651; Less Submitted 28 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

This immense growth stemmed partially from the stress of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to content that promotes eating disorders via social media, which, within the last decade, has become plagued by pro-eating disorder content. This study aimed to create a deep learning model capable of determining whether a given social media post promotes eating disorders based solely on image data. Tweets from hashtags that have been documented to promote eating disorders along with Tweets from unrelated hashtags were collected. After prepossessing, these images were labeled as either pro-eating disorder or not based on which Twitter hashtag they were scraped from. Several deep-learning models were trained on the scraped dataset and were evaluated based on their accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Ultimately, the Vision Transformer model was determined to be the most accurate, attaining an F1 score of 0.877 and an accuracy of 86.7% on the test set. The model, which was applied to unlabeled Twitter image data scraped from &#34;#selfie&#34;, uncovered seasonal fluctuations in the relative abundance of pro-eating disorder content, which reached its peak in the summertime. These fluctuations correspond not only to the seasons, but also to stressors, such as the Covid - 19 pandemic. Moreover, the Twitter image data indicated that the relative amount of pro-eating disorder content has been steadily rising over the last five years and is likely to continue increasing in the future. &#9651; Less Submitted 1 January, 2023; v1 submitted 28 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.13929 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; eess.IV cs.CV Evaluating Generalizability of Deep Learning Models Using Indian- COVID - 19 CT Dataset Authors: Suba S , Nita Parekh , Ramesh Loganathan , Vikram Pudi , Chinnababu Sunkavalli Abstract : Computer tomography (CT) have been routinely used for the diagnosis of lung diseases and recently, during the pandemic, for detecting the infectivity and severity of COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Computer tomography (CT) have been routinely used for the diagnosis of lung diseases and recently, during the pandemic, for detecting the infectivity and severity of COVID - 19 disease. One of the major concerns in using ma-chine learning (ML) approaches for automatic processing of CT scan images in clinical setting is that these methods are trained on limited and biased sub-sets of publicly available COVID - 19 data. This has raised concerns regarding the generalizability of these models on external datasets, not seen by the model during training. To address some of these issues, in this work CT scan images from confirmed COVID - 19 data obtained from one of the largest public repositories, COVIDx CT 2A were used for training and internal vali-dation of machine learning models. For the external validation we generated Indian- COVID - 19 CT dataset, an open-source repository containing 3D CT volumes and 12096 chest CT images from 288 COVID - 19 patients from In-dia. Comparative performance evaluation of four state-of-the-art machine learning models, viz., a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), and three other CNN based deep learning (DL) models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 in classifying CT images into three classes, viz., normal, non- covid pneumonia, and COVID - 19 is carried out on these two datasets. Our analysis showed that the performance of all the models is comparable on the hold-out COVIDx CT 2A test set with 90% - 99% accuracies (96% for CNN), while on the external Indian- COVID - 19 CT dataset a drop in the performance is observed for all the models (8% - 19 %).

The COVID - 19 pandemic had a major outbreak in January 2020 and was followed by different preventive measures, lockdown, and finally by the process of vaccination. To date, more comprehensive analysis of news related to COVID - 19 pandemic are missing, especially those which explain what aspects of this pandemic are being reported by newspapers inserted in different economies and belonging to different political alignments. Since LDA is often less coherent when there are news articles published across the world about an event and you look answers for specific queries. It is because of having semantically different content. To address this challenge, we performed pooling of news articles based on information retrieval using TF-IDF score in a data processing step and topic modeling using LDA with combination of 1 to 6 ngrams. We used VADER sentiment analyzer to analyze the differences in sentiments in news articles reported across different geographical places. The novelty of this study is to look at how COVID - 19 pandemic was reported by the media, providing a comparison among countries in different political and economic contexts. Our findings suggest that the news reporting by newspapers with different political alignment support the reported content. Also, economic issues reported by newspapers depend on economy of the place where a newspaper resides. &#9651; Less Submitted 15 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.13788 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG Explainable and Lightweight Model for COVID - 19 Detection Using Chest Radiology Images Authors: Suba S , Nita Parekh Abstract : Deep learning (DL) analysis of Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed tomography (CT) images has garnered a lot of attention in recent times due to the COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Deep learning (DL) analysis of Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed tomography (CT) images has garnered a lot of attention in recent times due to the COVID - 19 pandemic. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well suited for the image analysis tasks when trained on humongous amounts of data. Applications developed for medical image analysis require high sensitivity and precision compared to any other fields. Most of the tools proposed for detection of COVID - 19 claims to have high sensitivity and recalls but have failed to generalize and perform when tested on unseen datasets. This encouraged us to develop a CNN model, analyze and understand the performance of it by visualizing the predictions of the model using class activation maps generated using (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) Grad-CAM technique. This study provides a detailed discussion of the success and failure of the proposed model at an image level. Performance of the model is compared with state-of-the-art DL models and shown to be comparable.

We ran a contextual adaptive experiment on Facebook Messenger with users in Kenya and Nigeria and tested 40 combinations of interventions aimed at decreasing intentions to share misinformation while maintaining intentions to share factual posts related to COVID - 19 . We estimate precise null effects of showing users warning flags or suggesting related articles alongside misleading posts, tactics used by social media platforms. Instead, users share more discerningly when they are given tips for spotting misinformation or are nudged to consider information&#39;s accuracy, reducing misinformation sharing by 7.5% and 4.5% relative to control, respectively. We find significant heterogeneity in response to these treatments across users, indicating tips and the accuracy nudge affect outcomes through separate mechanisms. These low-cost, scalable interventions have the potential to improve the quality of information circulating online. &#9651; Less Submitted 10 January, 2023; v1 submitted 27 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Given the long hours an average person spends in buildings and indoor environments, this research article proposes data-driven control strategies to design optimal indoor airflow to minimize the exposure of occupants to viral pathogens in built environments. A general control framework is put forward for designing an optimal velocity field and proximal policy optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to solve the control problem in a data-driven fashion. The same framework is used for optimal placement of disinfectants to neutralize the viral pathogens as an alternative to the airflow design when the latter is practically infeasible or hard to implement. We show, via simulation experiments, that the control agent learns the optimal policy in both scenarios within a reasonable time. The proposed data-driven control framework in this study will have significant societal and economic benefits by setting the foundation for an improved methodology in designing case-specific infection control guidelines that can be realized by affordable ventilation devices and disinfectants. &#9651; Less Submitted 27 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.13470 &nbsp;[ pdf , ps , other ]&nbsp; physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE q-bio.QM Age-specific transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 during the first two years of the pandemic Authors: Otilia Boldea , Amir Alipoor , Sen Pei , Jeffrey Shaman , Ganna Rozhnova Abstract : During its first two years, the SARS -&hellip; &#9661; More During its first two years, the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic manifested as multiple waves shaped by complex interactions between variants of concern, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the immunological landscape of the population. Understanding how the age-specific epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 has evolved throughout the pandemic is crucial for informing policy decisions. We developed an inference-based modelling approach to reconstruct the burden of true infections and hospital admissions in children, adolescents and adults over the seven waves of four variants (wild-type, Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1) during the first two years of the pandemic, using the Netherlands as the motivating example. We find that reported cases are a considerable underestimate and a generally poor predictor of true infection burden, especially because case reporting differs by age. The contribution of children and adolescents to total infection and hospitalization burden increased with successive variants and was largest during the Omicron BA.1 period. Before the Delta period, almost all infections were primary infections occurring in naive individuals. During the Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods, primary infections were common in children but relatively rare in adults who experienced either re-infections or breakthrough infections. Our approach can be used to understand age-specific epidemiology through successive waves in other countries where random community surveys uncovering true SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics are absent but basic surveillance and statistics data are available. &#9651; Less Submitted 27 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

In particular, we work with a random transmission rate and we assume that the true number of infectious people at any observation time is random and not directly observable, to account for asymptomatic and non-tested people. We elaborate a nested particle filtering approach to estimate the reproduction rate and the model parameters.

When COVID - 19 patients undergo radiography examination, radiologists can observe the present of radiographic abnormalities from their chest X-ray (CXR) images. In this study, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model was proposed to aid radiologists in diagnosing COVID - 19 patients. First, this work conducted a comparative study on the performance of modified VGG-16, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 to classify CXR images into normal, COVID - 19 and viral pneumonia. Then, the impact of image augmentation on the classification results was evaluated. The publicly available COVID - 19 Radiography Database was used throughout this study. After comparison, ResNet-50 achieved the highest accuracy with 95.88%. Next, after training ResNet-50 with rotation, translation, horizontal flip, intensity shift and zoom augmented dataset, the accuracy dropped to 80.95%. Furthermore, an ablation study on the effect of image augmentation on the classification results found that the combinations of rotation and intensity shift augmentation methods obtained an accuracy higher than baseline, which is 96.14%. Finally, ResNet-50 with rotation and intensity shift augmentations performed the best and was proposed as the final classification model in this work. These findings demonstrated that the proposed classification model can provide a promising result for COVID - 19 diagnosis. &#9651; Less Submitted 26 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.12891 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; econ.GN doi 10.56472/25835238/IRJEMS-V1I2P107 Analysis of the Driving Factors of Implementing Green Supply Chain Management in SME in the City of Semarang Authors: Nanang Adie Setyawan , Hadiahti Utami , Bayu Setyo Nugroho , Mellasanti Ayuwardani , Suharmanto Abstract : This study set out to determine what motivated SMEs in Semarang City to undertake green supply chain management during the COVID - 19 and New Normal pandemics.

During this period, the number of crossings from Guatemala fell by 10%, according to the Survey of Migration to the Southern Border of Mexico. Yet, there was a rise of nearly 30% in the number of emigration crossings of male adults travelling with their children. This new trend was partly driven by the recent reduction in the number of children deported from the US. For a one-point reduction in the number of children deported from the US to Guatemalan municipalities, there was an increase of nearly 14 in the number of crossings made by adult males leaving from Guatemala for Mexico; and nearly 0.5 additional crossings made by male adults travelling with their children. However, the surge of emigrants travelling with their children was also driven by the acute economic shock that Guatemala experienced during the pandemic. During this period, air pollution in the analysed Guatemalan municipalities fell by 4%, night light per capita fell by 15%, and homicide rates fell by 40%. Unlike in previous years, emigrants are fleeing poverty rather than violence. Our findings suggest that a reduction in violence alone will not be sufficient to reduce emigration flows from Central America, but that economic recovery is needed. &#9651; Less Submitted 24 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.12550 &nbsp;[ pdf , ps , other ]&nbsp; math.NA FdeSolver: A Julia Package for Solving Fractional Differential Equations Authors: Moein Khalighi , Giulio Benedetti , Leo Lahti Abstract : &hellip;software development, and demonstrate the practical performance of the methods in two applications; we show how to simulate microbial community dynamics and model the spread of Covid - 19 by fitting the order of derivatives based on epidemiological observations.

The package covers solutions for one-dimensional equations with orders of positive real numbers. For high-dimensional systems, the orders of positive real numbers are limited to less than (and equal to) one. Incommensurate derivatives are allowed and defined in the Caputo sense. Here, we summarize the implementation for a representative class of problems, provide comparisons with available alternatives in Julia and Matlab, describe our adherence to good practices in open research software development, and demonstrate the practical performance of the methods in two applications; we show how to simulate microbial community dynamics and model the spread of Covid - 19 by fitting the order of derivatives based on epidemiological observations.

We propose a novel non-invasive tool, using deep learning and imaging, for delineating COVID - 19 infection in lungs. The Ensembling Attention-based Multi-scaled Convolution network (EAMC), employing Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO) training, exhibits high sensitivity and precision in outlining infected regions along with assessment of severity. The Attention module combines contextual with local information, at multiple scales, for accurate segmentation. Ensemble learning integrates heterogeneity of decision through different base classifiers. The superiority of EAMC, even with severe class imbalance, is established through comparison with existing state-of-the-art learning models over four publicly-available COVID - 19 datasets. The results are suggestive of the relevance of deep learning in providing assistive intelligence to medical practitioners, when they are overburdened with patients as in pandemics. Its clinical significance lies in its unprecedented scope in providing low-cost decision-making for patients lacking specialized healthcare at remote locations. &#9651; Less Submitted 23 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.12178 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.CR cs.CY COVID Down Under: where did Australia&#39;s pandemic apps go wrong?

Access to sports facilities depends on multiple factors, such as geographic location, proximity to population centers, budgetary constraints, and other socio-economic covariates. Here we show how an optimal allocation of government funds towards sports facilitators (e.g. sports clubs) can be achieved in a data-driven simulation model that maximizes children&#39;s access to sports facilities. We compile a dataset for all 1,854 football clubs in Austria, including estimates for their budget, geolocation, tally, and the age profile of their members. We find a characteristic sub-linear relationship between the number of active club members and the budget, which depends on the socio-economic conditions of the clubs&#39; municipality. In the model, where we assume this relationship to be causal, we evaluate different funding strategies. We show that an optimization strategy where funds are distributed based on regional socio-economic characteristics and club budgets outperforms a naive approach by up to 117\% in attracting children to sports clubs for 5 million Euros of additional funding. Our results suggest that the impact of public funding strategies can be substantially increased by tailoring them to regional socio-economic characteristics in an evidence-based and individualized way. &#9651; Less Submitted 21 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.10914 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; physics.soc-ph To Jab or Not to Jab?

The perceived reliability and effectiveness of available vaccines turn out to be important drivers in lowering vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, higher hesitancy is associated with being of a younger age or having lower education. Furthermore, comparing vaccine attitudes from observations before a major COVID - 19 wave with those from after, we find that the latter are significantly less hesitant about getting the vaccine. We also find that in addition to the standard knowledge and awareness campaigns, local level peer influences are important factors that affect vaccine hesitancy. Finally, we use statistically significant estimates from logistic regression on our survey data in a synthetic heterogeneous complex network-based society, to extrapolate scenarios that may arise from the dynamic interactions between our variables of interest. We use outcomes from this simulated society to suggest strategic interventions that may lower vaccine hesitancy. &#9651; Less Submitted 21 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.09963 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; stat.AP cs.SI physics.soc-ph Use of mobile phone sensing data to estimate residence and mobility times in urban patches during the COVID - 19 epidemic: The case of the 2020 outbreak in Hermosillo, Mexico Authors: L.

Distinct morphological patterns emerge when bio-colloids undergo drying, with significant potential in a range of biomedical applications, spanning bio-sensing, medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and antimicrobial resistance. This review presents a comprehensive overview of bio-colloidal droplets drying on solid substrates, focusing on the experimental progress during the last ten years. We provide a summary of the relevant properties of bio-colloids and link their composition (constituent particles, solvent, and concentrations) to the patterns emerging due to drying. We examined the drying patterns generated by passive bio-colloids (DNA, globular, fibrous, and composite proteins, plasma, serum, blood, urine, tears, saliva). This article highlights how morphological patterns are influenced by the nature of the biological entities and the solvent, micro- and global environmental conditions. Correlations between emergent patterns and the initial droplet compositions enable the detection of potential clinical abnormalities when compared with the patterns of drying droplets of healthy control samples, offering a diagnostic blueprint. Recent experimental investigations of pattern formation in the bio-mimetic and salivary drying droplets, relevant to COVID - 19 are also presented.

Detecting COVID - 19 from chest X-Ray (CXR) images has become one of the fastest and easiest methods for detecting COVID - 19 since the common occurrence of radiological pneumonia findings in COVID - 19 patients. We present a novel high-accuracy COVID - 19 detection method that uses CXR images. Methods: Our method consists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; the other is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervised learning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXR images without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in a batch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detection performance. Unlike our previous implementation, we introduce batch knowledge ensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the memory used in self-supervised learning and improving COVID - 19 detection accuracy. Results: On two public COVID - 19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset and an unbalanced dataset, our method exhibited promising COVID - 19 detection performance. Our method maintains high detection accuracy even when annotated CXR training images are reduced significantly (e.g., using only 10% of the original dataset). In addition, our method is insensitive to changes in hyperparameters. Conclusions: The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art COVID - 19 detection methods in different settings. Our method can reduce the workloads of healthcare providers and radiologists. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Since many confirmed COVID - 19 cases present radiological findings of pneumonia, radiologic examinations can be useful for fast detection. Therefore, chest radiography can be used to fast screen COVID - 19 during the patient triage, thereby determining the priority of patient&#39;s care to help saturated medical facilities in a pandemic situation. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme called self-supervised transfer learning for detecting COVID - 19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. We compared six self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (Cross, BYOL, SimSiam, SimCLR, PIRL-jigsaw, and PIRL-rotation) with the proposed method. Additionally, we compared six pretrained DCNNs (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, CheXNet, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3) with the proposed method. We provide quantitative evaluation on the largest open COVID - 19 CXR dataset and qualitative results for visual inspection. Results: Our method achieved a harmonic mean (HM) score of 0.985, AUC of 0.999, and four-class accuracy of 0.953. We also used the visualization technique Grad-CAM++ to generate visual explanations of different classes of CXR images with the proposed method to increase the interpretability. Conclusions: Our method shows that the knowledge learned from natural images using transfer learning is beneficial for SSL of the CXR images and boosts the performance of representation learning for COVID - 19 detection. Our method promises to reduce the incidence of infections among radiologists and healthcare providers. &#9651; Less Submitted 19 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Likewise, to enhance the regular face shield available in the market. Furthermore, to raise awareness of the health and safety protocols initiated by the government and its affiliates in the enforcement of social distancing with the integration of computer vision algorithms. The wearable device was composed of various hardware and software components such as a transparent polycarbonate face shield, microprocessor, sensors, camera, thin-film transistor on-screen display, jumper wires, power bank, and python programming language. The algorithm incorporated in the study was object detection under computer vision machine learning. The front camera with OpenCV technology determines the distance of a person in front of the user. Utilizing TensorFlow, the target object identifies and detects the image or live feed to get its bounding boxes. The focal length lens requires the determination of the distance from the camera to the target object. To get the focal length, multiply the pixel width by the known distance and divide it by the known width (Rosebrock, 2020). The deployment of unit testing ensures that the parameters are valid in terms of design and specifications. &#9651; Less Submitted 17 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Recent work has shown similar results hold for more flexible frequentist designs, such as information adaptive and adaptive multi-arm designs. However, covariate adjustment has not been characterized within the more flexible Bayesian adaptive designs, despite their growing popularity. We focus on a subclass of these which allow for early stopping at an interim analysis given evidence of treatment superiority. We consider both collapsible and non-collapsible estimands, and show how to marginalize posterior samples of conditional estimands. We describe several estimands for three common outcome types (continuous, binary, time-to-event). We perform a simulation study to assess the impact of covariate adjustment using a variety of adjustment models in several different scenarios. This is followed by a real world application of the compared approaches to a COVID - 19 trial with a binary endpoint. For all scenarios, it is shown that covariate adjustment increases power and the probability of stopping the trials early, and decreases the expected sample sizes as compared to unadjusted analyses. &#9651; Less Submitted 17 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Here, we characterize collective physical distancing -- mobility reductions, minimization of contacts, shortening of contact duration -- in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic in the pre-vaccine era by analyzing de-identified, privacy-preserving location data for a panel of over 5.5 million anonymized, opted-in U.S. devices. We define five indicators of users&#39; mobility and proximity to investigate how the emerging collective behavior deviates from the typical pre-pandemic patterns during the first nine months of the COVID - 19 pandemic. We analyze both the dramatic changes due to the government mandated mitigation policies and the more spontaneous societal adaptation into a new (physically distanced) normal in the fall 2020. The indicators defined here allow the quantification of behavior changes across the rural/urban divide and highlight the statistical association of mobility and proximity indicators with metrics characterizing the pandemic&#39;s social and public health impact such as unemployment and deaths. This study provides a framework to study massive social distancing phenomena with potential uses in analyzing and monitoring the effects of pandemic mitigation plans at the national and international level. &#9651; Less Submitted 17 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.08798 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.LG Leveraging Wastewater Monitoring for COVID - 19 Forecasting in the US: a Deep Learning study Authors: Mehrdad Fazli , Heman Shakeri Abstract : The outburst of COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More The outburst of COVID - 19 in late 2019 was the start of a health crisis that shook the world and took millions of lives in the ensuing years. Many governments and health officials failed to arrest the rapid circulation of infection in their communities. The long incubation period and the large proportion of asymptomatic cases made COVID - 19 particularly elusive to track. However, wastewater monitoring soon became a promising data source in addition to conventional indicators such as confirmed daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Despite the consensus on the effectiveness of wastewater viral load data, there is a lack of methodological approaches that leverage viral load to improve COVID - 19 forecasting. This paper proposes using deep learning to automatically discover the relationship between daily confirmed cases and viral load data. We trained one Deep Temporal Convolutional Networks (DeepTCN) and one Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to build a global forecasting model. We supplement the daily confirmed cases with viral loads and other socio-economic factors as covariates to the models. Our results suggest that TFT outperforms DeepTCN and learns a better association between viral load and daily cases. We demonstrated that equipping the models with the viral load improves their forecasting performance significantly. Moreover, viral load is shown to be the second most predictive input, following the containment and health index. Our results reveal the feasibility of training a location-agnostic deep-learning model to capture the dynamics of infection diffusion when wastewater viral load data is provided. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.08616 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.SI Translating Social Media Crisis Narratives into Road Network Utilization Metrics: The Case of 2020 Oklahoma Ice Storm Authors: H M Imran Kays , Khondhaker Al Momin , Menziwokuhle Bandise Thwala , K.

Despite a growing literature on infrastructure interdependencies and co-dependent social-physical systems, an in-depth understanding of how risk communication in online social networks weighs into physical infrastructure networks during a major disaster remains limited, let alone in compounding risk events. This study analyzes large-scale datasets of crisis mobility and activity-related social interactions and concerns available through social media (Twitter) for communities that were impacted by an ice storm (Oct. 2020) in Oklahoma. Compounded by the COVID - 19 pandemic, Oklahoma residents faced this historic ice storm (Oct. 26, 2020-Oct. 29, 2020) that caused devastating traffic impacts (among others) due to excessive ice accumulation. By using the recently released academic Application Programming Interface (API) by Twitter that provides complete and unbiased data, geotagged tweets (approx. 210K) were collected covering the entire state of Oklahoma, and ice storm-related tweets (approx. 14.2K) were considered. First, the study uses natural language processing and text quantification techniques to translate crisis narratives (i.e., tweets). Next, geo-tagged tweets are mapped into co-located road networks using traditional GIS techniques. Finally, insights are generated using network science theories and quantified social narratives to interpret different elements of road networks (e.g., local roads, freeways, etc.) for the Oklahoma communities that were impacted by the ice storm event during the pandemic. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.08571 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS stat.AP Statistical Design and Analysis for Robust Machine Learning: A Case Study from COVID - 19 Authors: Davide Pigoli , Kieran Baker , Jobie Budd , Lorraine Butler , Harry Coppock , Sabrina Egglestone , Steven G.

Here, we undertake a large scale study of audio-based deep learning classifiers, as part of the UK governments pandemic response. We collect and analyse a dataset of audio recordings from 67,842 individuals with linked metadata, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test outcomes, of whom 23,514 tested positive for SARS CoV 2 . Subjects were recruited via the UK governments National Health Service Test-and-Trace programme and the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) randomised surveillance survey. In an unadjusted analysis of our dataset AI classifiers predict SARS - CoV - 2 infection status with high accuracy (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROCAUC) 0.846 [0.838, 0.854]) consistent with the findings of previous studies. However, after matching on measured confounders, such as age, gender, and self reported symptoms, our classifiers performance is much weaker (ROC-AUC 0.619 [0.594, 0.644]). Upon quantifying the utility of audio based classifiers in practical settings, we find them to be outperformed by simple predictive scores based on user reported symptoms. &#9651; Less Submitted 15 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.08498 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; stat.AP cs.AI math.DS Evaluating vaccine allocation strategies using simulation-assisted causal modelling Authors: Armin Kekić , Jonas Dehning , Luigi Gresele , Julius von Kügelgen , Viola Priesemann , Bernhard Schölkopf Abstract : &hellip;crucial element of pandemics response.

Evaluating vaccine allocation is therefore a crucial element of pandemics response. In the present work, we develop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual vaccine allocation strategies against the COVID - 19 pandemic. To estimate the effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a simulation-assisted causal modelling approach which combines a compartmental infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained, data-driven causal model and literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel&#39;s implemented vaccine allocation strategy in 2021 to counterfactual strategies such as no prioritisation, prioritisation of younger age groups or a strict risk-ranked approach; we find that Israel&#39;s implemented strategy was indeed highly effective. We also study the marginal impact of increasing vaccine uptake for a given age group and find that increasing vaccinations in the elderly is most effective at preventing severe cases, whereas additional vaccinations for middle-aged groups reduce infections most effectively. Due to its modular structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We demonstrate this flexibility by investigating vaccine allocation strategies for a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish Flu. Our approach thus helps evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine availability and spreading rates. &#9651; Less Submitted 14 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.08481 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.LG cs.CY q-bio.PE Neural Network Augmented Compartmental Pandemic Models Authors: Lorenz Kummer , Kevin Sidak Abstract : &hellip;effects into account and offers improved predictive power as well as counterfactual analysis capabilities.

It is not only critical to study the generative nature of a virus and understand the dynamics of transmission that vary by time and location but also crucial to provide accurate estimates that are robust to the data errors and model assumptions due to limited understanding of the new virus. We bridged the epidemiology of pathogens and statistical techniques to propose a hybrid statistical-epidemiological model so that the model is generative in nature yet utilizes statistics to model the effect of covariates (e.g., time and interventions), stochastic dependence, and uncertainty of data. Our model considers disease case counts as random variables and imposes moment assumptions on the number of secondary cases of existing infected individuals at the time since infection.

Audio recordings of volitional coughs, exhalations, and speech were collected in the &#39;Speak up to help beat coronavirus &#39; digital survey alongside demographic, self-reported symptom and respiratory condition data, and linked to SARS - CoV - 2 test results. The UK COVID - 19 Vocal Audio Dataset represents the largest collection of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR-referenced audio recordings to date. PCR results were linked to 70,794 of 72,999 participants and 24,155 of 25,776 positive cases. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 45.62% of participants. This dataset has additional potential uses for bioacoustics research, with 11.30% participants reporting asthma, and 27.20% with linked influenza PCR test results. &#9651; Less Submitted 15 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

The graph it induces is not only useful for describing the relationship between random variables but also critical for improving statistical estimation precision. In high-dimensional data analysis, despite an abundant literature on estimating this graph structure, tests for the adequacy of its specification at a global level is severely underdeveloped. To make progress, this paper proposes a novel goodness-of-fit test that is computationally easy and theoretically tractable. Under the null hypothesis, it is shown that asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistic follows a Gumbel distribution. Interestingly the location parameter of this limiting Gumbel distribution depends on the dependence structure under the null. We further develop a novel consistency-empowered test statistic when the true structure is nested in the postulated structure, by amplifying the noise incurred in estimation. Extensive simulation illustrates that the proposed test procedure has the right size under the null, and is powerful under the alternative. As an application, we apply the test to the analysis of a COVID - 19 data set, demonstrating that our test can serve as a valuable tool in choosing a graph structure to improve estimation efficiency. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.06696 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.HC cs.CY doi 10.1145/3491102.3517717 A Comparative Evaluation of Interventions Against Misinformation: Augmenting the WHO Checklist Authors: Hendrik Heuer , Elena Leah Glassman Abstract : During the COVID - 19 pandemic, the World Health Organization provided a checklist to help people distinguish between accurate and misinformation.

In controlled experiments in the United States and Germany, we investigated the utility of this ordered checklist and designed an interactive version to lower the cost of acting on checklist items. Across interventions, we observe non-trivial differences in participants&#39; performance in distinguishing accurate and misinformation between the two countries and discuss some possible reasons that may predict the future helpfulness of the checklist in different environments. The checklist item that provides source labels was most frequently followed and was considered most helpful. Based on our empirical findings, we recommend practitioners focus on providing source labels rather than interventions that support readers performing their own fact-checks, even though this recommendation may be influenced by the WHO&#39;s chosen order. We discuss the complexity of providing such source labels and provide design recommendations. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Similarly, the design of non-pharmaceutical interventions has played a key role in the application of policies to contain the spread. However, there is less work done regarding quantitative approaches to characterize the impact of each intervention, which can greatly vary depending on the culture, region, and specific circumstances of the population under consideration. In this work, we develop a high-resolution, data-driven agent-based model of the spread of COVID - 19 among the population in five Spanish cities. These populations synthesize multiple data sources that summarize the main interaction environments leading to potential contacts. We simulate the spreading of COVID - 19 in these cities and study the effect of several non-pharmaceutical interventions. We illustrate the potential of our approach through a case study and derive the impact of the most relevant interventions through scenarios where they are suppressed. Our framework constitutes a first tool to simulate different intervention scenarios for decision-making. &#9651; Less Submitted 13 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Local policy regimes provide flexibility between regions, but may become less effective in the presence of geographic spillovers, where populations circumvent local restrictions by traveling to less restricted regions nearby. Due to the endogenous nature of policymaking, there have been few opportunities to reliably estimate causal spillover effects or evaluate their impact on local policies. In this work, we identify a novel setting and develop a suitable methodology that allow us to make unconfounded estimates of spillover effects of local policies. Focusing on California&#39;s Blueprint for a Safer Economy, we leverage how county-level mobility restrictions were deterministically set by public COVID - 19 severity statistics, enabling a regression discontinuity design framework to estimate spillovers between counties. We estimate these effects using a mobility network with billions of timestamped edges and find significant spillover movement, with larger effects in retail, eating places, and gyms. Contrasting local and global policy regimes, our spillover estimates suggest that county-level restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide restrictions at reducing mobility. However, an intermediate strategy of macro-county restrictions -- where we optimize county partitions by solving a minimum k-cut problem on a graph weighted by our spillover estimates -- can recover over 90% of statewide mobility reductions, while maintaining substantial flexibility between counties. &#9651; Less Submitted 12 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

The training of an end-to-end neural based dialog system, on the other hand, is hampered by a lack of multi-turn medical dialog corpus. We make the very first attempt to release a high-quality multi-turn Medical Dialog dataset relating to Covid - 19 disease named CDialog, with over 1K conversations collected from the online medical counselling websites. We annotate each utterance of the conversation with seven different categories of medical entities, including diseases, symptoms, medical tests, medical history, remedies, medications and other aspects as additional labels. Finally, we propose a novel neural medical dialog system based on the CDialog dataset to advance future research on developing automated medical dialog systems. We use pre-trained language models for dialogue generation, incorporating annotated medical entities, to generate a virtual doctor&#39;s response that addresses the patient&#39;s query. Experimental results show that the proposed dialog models perform comparably better when supplemented with entity information and hence can improve the response quality. &#9651; Less Submitted 16 November, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.05707 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.LG Human Mobility Modeling During the COVID - 19 Pandemic via Deep Graph Diffusion Infomax Authors: Yang Liu , Yu Rong , Zhuoning Guo , Nuo Chen , Tingyang Xu , Fugee Tsung , Jia Li Abstract : Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), such as social gathering restrictions, have shown effectiveness to slow the transmission of COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), such as social gathering restrictions, have shown effectiveness to slow the transmission of COVID - 19 by reducing the contact of people. To support policy-makers, multiple studies have first modeled human mobility via macro indicators (e.g., average daily travel distance) and then studied the effectiveness of NPIs. In this work, we focus on mobility modeling and, from a micro perspective, aim to predict locations that will be visited by COVID - 19 cases. Since NPIs generally cause economic and societal loss, such a micro perspective prediction benefits governments when they design and evaluate them. However, in real-world situations, strict privacy data protection regulations result in severe data sparsity problems (i.e., limited case and location information). To address these challenges, we formulate the micro perspective mobility modeling into computing the relevance score between a diffusion and a location, conditional on a geometric graph. we propose a model named Deep Graph Diffusion Infomax (DGDI), which jointly models variables including a geometric graph, a set of diffusions and a set of locations.To facilitate the research of COVID - 19 prediction, we present two benchmarks that contain geometric graphs and location histories of COVID - 19 cases. Extensive experiments on the two benchmarks show that DGDI significantly outperforms other competing methods. &#9651; Less Submitted 12 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.05669 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.HC cs.LG Development of Personalized Sleep Induction System based on Mental States Authors: Young-Seok Kweon , Gi-Hwan Shin , Heon-Gyu Kwak Abstract : &hellip;motor, and emotional performance and various diseases.

During the COVID - 19 pandemic, the demand for liquid medical oxygen (LMO) has increased significantly due to the occurrence of lung infections in many patients. However, many countries and regions are not prepared for the emergence of this phenomenon, and the limited supply of LMO has resulted in unsatisfied usage needs in many regions. In this paper, we formulated a linear programming model with the objective to minimize the unsatisfied demand given the constraints of supply and transportation capacity. The decision variables are how much LMO should be transferred from a place to another at each time interval using a specific number of vehicles. Multiple storage points are added into the network to allow for more flexible allocation strategies. The proposed model is implemented in India with real-world LMO supply and demand data as a case study. Compared to the manually designed allocation strategy, the proposed model successfully reduces the unsatisfied demand. &#9651; Less Submitted 14 December, 2022; v1 submitted 11 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.05369 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; q-fin.ST stat.AP Time Series Analysis in American Stock Market Recovering in Post COVID - 19 Pandemic Period Authors: Weilin Fu , Zhuoran Li , Yupeng Zhang , Xingyou Zhou Abstract : &hellip;Average collected from Yahoo Finance, this study implemented Deep Learning, Neuro Network, and Time-series to analyze the trend of the American Stock Market in the post- COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More Every financial crisis has caused a dual shock to the global economy.

Hong Kong has implemented stringent public health and social measures (PHSMs) to curb COVID - 19 epidemic waves since the first COVID - 19 case was confirmed on 22 January 2020. People are likely to engage in collective behaviour online during extreme events, such as the COVID - 19 crisis, to express their awareness, actions and concerns. Here, we offer a framework to evaluate interactions among individuals emotions, perception, and online behaviours in Hong Kong during the first two waves (February to June 2020) and found a strong correlation between online behaviours of Google search and the real-time reproduction numbers. To validate the model output of risk perception, we conducted 10 rounds of cross-sectional telephone surveys from February 1 through June 20 in 2020 to quantify risk perception levels over time. Compared with the survey results, the estimates of the risk perception of individuals using our network-based mechanistic model capture 80% of the trend of people risk perception (individuals who worried about being infected) during the studied period. We may need to reinvigorate the public by engaging people as part of the solution to live their lives with reduced risk. &#9651; Less Submitted 10 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.05181 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; cs.RO cs.MA Exploiting the Power of Human-Robot Collaboration: Coupling and Scale Effects in Bricklaying Authors: Jia-Rui Lin , Ming-Hui Wu Abstract : As an important contributor to GDP growth, the construction industry is suffering from labor shortage due to population ageing, COVID -&hellip; &#9661; More As an important contributor to GDP growth, the construction industry is suffering from labor shortage due to population ageing, COVID - 19 pandemic, and harsh environments. Considering the complexity and dynamics of construction environment, it is still challenging to develop fully automated robots. For a long time in the future, workers and robots will coexist and collaborate with each other to build or maintain a facility efficiently. As an emerging field, human-robot collaboration (HRC) still faces various open problems. To this end, this pioneer research introduces an agent-based modeling approach to investigate the coupling effect and scale effect of HRC in the bricklaying process. With multiple experiments based on simulation, the dynamic and complex nature of HRC is illustrated in two folds: 1) agents in HRC are interdependent due to human factors of workers, features of robots, and their collaboration behaviors; 2 ) different parameters of HRC are correlated and have significant impacts on construction productivity (CP). Accidentally and interestingly, it is discovered that HRC has a scale effect on CP, which means increasing the number of collaborated human-robot teams will lead to higher CP even if the human-robot ratio keeps unchanged. Overall, it is argued that more investigations in HRC are needed for efficient construction, occupational safety, etc.; and this research can be taken as a stepstone for developing and evaluating new robots, optimizing HRC processes, and even training future industrial workers in the construction industry. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.05035 &nbsp;[ pdf , other ]&nbsp; cs.CY cs.IR math.NA stat.ME COVID - 19 Activity Risk Calculator as a Gamified Public Health Intervention Tool Authors: Shreyasvi Natraj , Malhar Bhide , Nathan Yap , Meng Liu , Agrima Seth , Jonathan Berman , Christin Glorioso Abstract : &hellip;the negative impact of several epidemics and pandemics.

Among all of the wide-spread diseases, one of the most dangerous one has been severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) or Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ). The impact of the virus has been observed in over 200 countries leading to hospitalizations and deaths of millions of people. Currently existing COVID - 19 risk estimation tools provided to the general public have been highly variable during the pandemic due to its dependency on rapidly evolving factors such as community transmission levels and variants. There has also been confusion surrounding certain personal protective strategies such as risk reduction by mask-wearing and vaccination. In order to create a simplified easy-to-use tool for estimating different individual risks associated with carrying out daily-life activity, we developed COVID - 19 Activity Risk Calculator (CovARC). CovARC serves as a gamified public health intervention as users can &#34;play with&#34; how different risks associated with COVID - 19 would change depending on several different factors when carrying out a daily routine activity. Empowering the public to make informed, data-driven decisions about safely engaging in activities may help to reduce COVID - 19 levels in the community. In this study, we demonstrate a streamlined, scalable and accurate COVID - 19 risk calculation system. Our study also showcases quantitatively, the increased impact of interventions such as vaccination and mask-wearing when cases are higher, which could prove as a validity to inform and support policy decisions around mask mandate case thresholds and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. &#9651; Less Submitted 22 December, 2022; v1 submitted 5 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.

Several studies attempted to detect the physiological value from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR). However, the technology has limited availability with high cost. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel framework called PACMAN (Pandemic Accelerated Human-Machine Collaboration) with a low-resource deep learning-based computer vision. We compared state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (scaled YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOR), including the commercial OCR tools for digit recognition on the captured images from pulse oximeter display. All images were derived from crowdsourced data collection with varying quality and alignment. YOLOv5 was the best-performing model against the given model comparison across all datasets, notably the correctly orientated image dataset. We further improved the model performance with the digits auto-orientation algorithm and applied a clustering algorithm to extract SpO2 and PR values. The accuracy performance of YOLOv5 with the implementations was approximately 81.0-89.5%, which was enhanced compared to without any additional implementation. Accordingly, this study highlighted the completion of PACMAN framework to detect and read digits in real-world datasets. The proposed framework has been currently integrated into the patient monitoring system utilized by hospitals nationwide. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.04911 &nbsp;[ pdf ]&nbsp; stat.ME A Design and Analytic Strategy for Monitoring Disease Positivity and Case Characteristics in Accessible Closed Populations Authors: Robert H.

The proposed design relies largely on voluntary testing, notoriously biased (e.g., in the case of COVID - 19 ) due to non-representative sampling. The approach yields unbiased and comparatively precise estimates with no assumptions about factors underlying selection of individuals for voluntary testing, building on the strength of what can be a small random sampling component. This component unlocks a previously proposed &#34;anchor stream&#34; estimator, a well-calibrated alternative to classical capture-recapture (CRC) estimators based on two data streams. We show here that this estimator is equivalent to a direct standardization based on &#34;capture&#34;, i.e., selection (or not) by the voluntary testing program, made possible by means of a key parameter identified by design. This equivalency simultaneously allows for novel two-stream CRC-like estimation of general means (e.g., of continuous variables such as antibody levels or biomarkers). For inference, we propose adaptations of a Bayesian credible interval when estimating case counts and bootstrapping when estimating means of continuous variables. We use simulations to demonstrate significant precision benefits relative to random sampling alone. &#9651; Less Submitted 9 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022. arXiv:2212.04545 &nbsp;[ pdf , ps , other ]&nbsp; physics.soc-ph math.PR q-bio.PE doi 10.1016/j.idm.2022.10.003 The role of super-spreaders in modeling of SARS - CoV - 2 Authors: F Rousse , M Carlsson , M Ogren , B Kalischer Wellander Abstract : &hellip;finite population representing a medium size city, where the degree of infectivity is determined by the offspring distribution, which we try to make as realistic as possible for SARS - CoV - 2 .

However, such conclusions are derived under idealized assumptions such as the population size tending to infinity, and the individual degree of infectivity only depending on variations in the infectiousness period. In this paper we show that the same conclusions hold true in a finite population representing a medium size city, where the degree of infectivity is determined by the offspring distribution, which we try to make as realistic as possible for SARS - CoV - 2 . In particular, we consider distributions with fat tails, to incorporate the existence of super-spreaders. We also provide new theoretical results on convergence of stochastic models which allows to incorporate any offspring distribution with a finite variance. &#9651; Less Submitted 8 December, 2022; originally announced December 2022.
