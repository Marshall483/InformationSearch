All articles on arXiv.org can be viewed and downloaded freely by anyone. To maintain this scholarly record, arXiv needs permission from submitters to post and distribute their work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the submitter, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license. Several types of licenses are available, listed below. For all licenses here, with the exception of CC Zero, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv. How to choose a license arXiv values open access and encourages choosing a liberal license for re-use of the paper. However, each situation is unique. Funders may require specific licenses. Journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Please note that different versions of the work can have different licenses. Ultimately, it is the submitterâs responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content. The license chosen is irrevocable and cannot be changed. To make a license decision, arXiv recommends the following: Read and understand the submission terms and agreement and instructions for submission Understand the meanings and implications of each license below Check the policies of funders and journals (contact journals directly or using a third-party service such as Sherpa Romeo ) Consult with colleagues in your field of study Remember that articles posted on arXiv are a permanent part of the scholarly record and the license chosen for each version is irrevocable Licenses available CC BY : Creative Commons Attribution This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use. Are you submitting a preprint and plan to publish this work in a journal? Many publishers allow preprints to be deposited with a CC BY license. Check directly with the journal to find out. CC BY-SA : Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use. If you remix, adapt, or build upon the material, you must license the modified material under identical terms. CC BY-NC-SA : Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format for noncommercial purposes only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator. If you remix, adapt, or build upon the material, you must license the modified material under identical terms. CC BY-NC-ND : Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives This license allows reusers to copy and distribute the material in any medium or format in unadapted form only, for noncommercial purposes only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator. Many publishers allow âaccepted manuscriptsâ to be deposited with a CC BY-NC-ND license, but there may be an embargo period. Check the journalâs policies to be certain. arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license This license gives limited rights to arXiv to distribute the article, and also limits re-use of any type from other entities or individuals. Some authors require a license that is not listed here. As long as the desired license does not restrict arXivâs license, authors can select the arXiv license and then indicate the desired license in the first page of the article. This is a requirement of some funders and governments. CC Zero is a public dedication tool, which allows creators to give up their copyright and put their works into the worldwide public domain. CC0 allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, with no conditions. If you choose this license, you will no longer control the articleâs copyright. A work distributed with CC Zero would not allow for copyright transfer, and this conflicts with many publishersâ requirements. Metadata license A Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication will apply to all metadata. Copyright notices Often, PDFs found on publisher websites or supplied as proofs are the property of the publisher, which often owns the copyright and/or licenses their use. Submission of PDFs with copyright statements which prohibit or impair arXiv's redistribution license will be rejected. If explicit permission is given for open access redistribution, these are permissible.
Users should contact our User Support team if they have questions. If you have permission from a publisher to upload content to arXiv provided that you include a special copyright statement with the paper, place that statement on the first page of the text of the submission. Copyright notices should not be included in the separate metadata and will be removed. If you have any additional questions about arXiv's copyright and licensing policies, please contact our User Support team directly.
