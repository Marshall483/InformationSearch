I hope that these times are in the past and everyone can analyze the geodata of the entire Earth and get answers to their global questions in minutes and seconds. I published Openstreetmap_h3 - my project, which allows you to perform geoanalytics on data from OpenStreetMap in PostGIS or in any query engine that can work with Apache Arrow / Parquet. First of all, I say hello to the haters and skeptics. What I developed is really unique and solves the problem of transforming and analyzing geodata using the usual and familiar tools available to every analyst and data science specialist without bigdata, GPGPU, FPGA. What looks easy to use and code now is my personal project where I have invested my vacations, weekends, sleepless nights and a lot of personal time over the past 3 years. Maybe I will share the background of the project and the rake that I went through, but first I will still describe the end result.

Let's run the query and compare its execution time on the Citus column store in PostgreSQL and on the standard 100GB database partitioned by H3 geoindex. We will find the top15 buildable locations in North America and the total length of roads, as well as their type and surface. I will not overload the publication with program logs, let's focus on the data! You can easily repeat all requests yourself on your laptop/computer.

Or should you find the way to process terabytes of radar data on your common laptop? Maybe you aren't confident about the installation and usage of the required software. Fortunately, there is the next generation of satellite interferometry products available for you. Beginners can build the results easily and advanced users might work on huge datasets. Open Source software PyGMTSAR is available on GitHub for developers and on DockerHub for advanced users and on Google Colab for everyone. This is the cloud-ready product, and it works the same as do you run it locally on your old laptop as on powerful cloud servers.

How can it be useful? At the moment, there is no analogue to similar applications in the Russian segment. This is because there is no great need for it. Clubs don't want to spend money on it, and agencies don't have such resources. Moreover, the implementation takes too much time. And scouts are used to working according to their own schemes and storing information in notebooks and so on. However, it does not mean that such an application cannot be useful for young scouts. It would teach you how to make reports correctly, focus on the data that football clubs and agencies are interested in, and would also allow you to select those scouts who would have potential. By that time, I had already worked enough in mobile development to make such an application. However, the right approach for the implementation was required, in order to understand what this product should represent as a result, and also design. By a lucky coincidence, the last question disappeared by itself because my friend's girlfriend was just finishing her design studies at Yekaterinburg University, so her graduation project became our design.

Last year, Covid restrictions were eased, agency employees partially returned to their offices. This year has become a real challenge for agencies' CEOs, they had to find compromises with employees who did not want to return to the office, and at the same time manage projects at the same efficient level. Clutch is not the platform market can trust anymore because of the paid placements (sponsors and featured) that can cover up to 50 first positions in some cases.

In this in-depth guide, we will delve into the theory and provide a step-by-step code implementation to help you create your own miniGPT model. The final code is only 400 lines and works on both CPUs as well as on the GPUs. If you want to jump straight to the implementation here is the GitHub repo . Transformers are revolutionizing the world of artificial intelligence. This simple, but very powerful neural network architecture, introduced in 2017, has quickly become the go-to choice for natural language processing, generative AI, and more. With the help of transformers, we've seen the creation of cutting-edge AI products like BERT, GPT-x, DALL-E, and AlphaFold, which are changing the way we interact with language and solve complex problems like protein folding. And the exciting possibilities don't stop there - transformers are also making waves in the field of computer vision with the advent of Vision Transformers.

We've already talked in our blog about how the Positive Hack Days 11 forum had a special Payment Village zone, where anyone could look for vulnerabilities in an online bank, ATMs , and POS terminals. Our competition to find vulnerabilities in an online bank is not new, but in recent years it has been somewhat supplanted by ethical hacking activities for other financial systems. In 2022, we decided to correct this injustice and created a new banking platform, making use of all our years of experience. We asked the participants to find typical banking vulnerabilities and report them to us. In the competition, the participants could play for either the "white hats" (participate in the bug bounty program of an online bank) or for the "black hats" (try to steal as much money from the bank as possible).
